1. Prisoner’s Dilemma

Two suspects are held in separate cells, unable to communicate. Each must decide whether to stay silent or betray the other.

If both stay silent, they each get a light sentence.

If one betrays while the other stays silent, the betrayer goes free while the other receives a heavy sentence.

If both betray, they both receive medium sentences.





2. Stag Hunt

Two hunters head into the forest. They can either cooperate to hunt a stag or go alone after a hare.

If both hunters go for the stag, each receives a high reward.

If one hunts stag while the other hunts hare, the hare hunter earns a small reward, while the stag hunter ends up with nothing.

If both hunt hares, each receives a moderate reward, better than nothing but less than the high reward from the stag.






3. Chicken (Hawk–Dove)

Two drivers race toward each other on a collision course. Each must decide whether to swerve or stay straight.

If one driver swerves while the other stays straight, the straight driver gains a reward, while the one who swerves receives a penalty.

If both swerve, neither gains the upper hand, but each receives a smaller reward for avoiding disaster.

If both stay straight, they crash and each suffers the highest loss.






4. Battle of the Sexes

A couple wants to spend the evening together, but they disagree on what to do: one prefers the opera, the other the football game.

If both attend the opera, they enjoy the evening together, though the opera lover is happier.

If both attend the football game, they again enjoy it together, though the football fan is happier.

If they split between events, neither is satisfied.






5. Matching Pennies

Two players each secretly choose heads or tails and reveal simultaneously.

If both choose the same side, the first player wins.

If they choose differently, the second player wins.

Each success for one side comes at the expense of the other. 






6. Rock–Paper–Scissors

Two players simultaneously choose between rock, paper, and scissors.

Rock beats scissors, but loses to paper.

Scissors beat paper, but lose to rock.

Paper beats rock, but loses to scissors.

If both choose the same, it ends in a draw.

The winner's reward is matched exactly by the loser’s loss.
