Description 1 Intelligence Briefing:

An analyst selects one of four reconnaissance methods: drone surveillance, cyber intrusion, human intel gathering, or satellite imaging.
The defense agency must respond with one of four countermeasures: electronic jamming, deploying field agents, activating signal cloaking, or launching misinformation.
The agency cannot distinguish between drone and human intel attempts, so both are handled within a single information set.
Similarly, cyber and satellite activities fall into another information set and receive identical responses.

If drone surveillance is met with jamming, the analyst gains 2 and the agency loses 2.
If agents are deployed, the analyst loses 1 and the agency gains 1.
If signal cloaking is used, both sides break even.
If misinformation is launched, the analyst gains 1 and the agency loses 1.

If cyber intrusion is attempted and jamming is used, both parties receive 0.
If agents are deployed, the analyst gains 3 and the agency loses 3.
If cloaking is activated, the analyst loses 2 and the agency gains 2.
If misinformation is used, the analyst gains 2 and the agency loses 2.

If human intel is used and jamming is activated, the analyst gains 1 and the agency loses 1.
If agents are deployed, the analyst loses 2 and the agency gains 2.
If cloaking is used, the analyst gains 2 and the agency loses 2.
If misinformation is launched, both sides receive 0.

If satellite imaging is conducted and jamming is used, the analyst gains 1 and the agency loses 1.
If agents are deployed, the analyst loses 3 and the agency gains 3.
If cloaking is used, both sides receive 0.
If misinformation is used, the analyst gains 3 and the agency loses 3.

Description 2 City Infrastructure Simulation:

A mayor selects one of four development projects: building a new highway, upgrading digital infrastructure, expanding parks, or investing in public housing.
The city council must then respond with one of four budget allocations: transportation, technology, environmental, or housing.
The council cannot distinguish between the highway and park proposals, handling them with the same budget strategy.
Meanwhile, digital upgrades and housing expansions share another decision point.

If the highway project meets a transportation budget, the mayor gains 2 and the council loses 2.
If technology is prioritized, the mayor loses 1 and the council gains 1.
If environmental funds are allocated, the outcome is neutral.
If housing is funded, the mayor gains 1 and the council loses 1.

If digital infrastructure is chosen and transport is prioritized, both sides receive 0.
If the tech budget is allocated, the mayor gains 3 and the council loses 3.
If environmental support is chosen, the mayor loses 2 and the council gains 2.
If housing is funded, the mayor gains 2 and the council loses 2.

If the park expansion meets a transport budget, the mayor gains 1 and the council loses 1.
If tech is funded, the mayor loses 2 and the council gains 2.
If environmental support is chosen, the mayor gains 2 and the council loses 2.
If housing is funded, both sides break even.

If public housing is selected and transport is prioritized, the mayor gains 1 and the council loses 1.
If tech is funded, the mayor loses 3 and the council gains 3.
If environmental funds are allocated, both sides receive 0.
If housing is funded, the mayor gains 3 and the council loses 3.

Description 3 Fantasy War Council:

A general must select one of four attack routes: through the northern mountains, via underground tunnels, across the plains, or by sea.
The enemy warlock chooses one of four defenses: summoning beasts, casting illusions, raising a barrier, or conjuring fog.
The warlock cannot distinguish between mountain and plains routes and reacts to both through a single decision point.
Tunnel and sea approaches are addressed through a separate defense strategy.

If the mountain route is met with beasts, the general gains 2 and the warlock loses 2.
If illusions are cast, the general loses 1 and the warlock gains 1.
If a barrier is raised, the battle is evenly matched.
If fog is conjured, the general gains 1 and the warlock loses 1.

If the tunnel is used and beasts are summoned, the outcome is neutral.
If illusions are cast, the general gains 3 and the warlock loses 3.
If a barrier is raised, the general loses 2 and the warlock gains 2.
If fog is conjured, the general gains 2 and the warlock loses 2.

If the plains are crossed and met with beasts, the general gains 1 and the warlock loses 1.
If illusions are used, the general loses 2 and the warlock gains 2.
If a barrier is summoned, the general gains 2 and the warlock loses 2.
If fog is conjured, both sides receive 0.

If the sea invasion is met with beasts, the general gains 1 and the warlock loses 1.
If illusions are used, the general loses 3 and the warlock gains 3.
If a barrier is raised instead, the battle ends evenly.
If fog is conjured, the general gains 3 and the warlock loses 3.

Description 4 University Scheduling Conflict:

A registrar selects one of four scheduling strategies: early morning classes, compressed 3-day weeks, rotating time blocks, or weekend intensives.
The student union responds with one of four feedback actions: student surveys, public protests, open forums, or petition campaigns.
The union cannot distinguish between early morning and rotating schedules, so their response is unified.
Compressed weeks and weekend classes also fall under a shared decision point.

If early classes are met with surveys, the registrar gains 2 and the union loses 2.
If protests are launched, the registrar loses 1 and the union gains 1.
If forums are held, the response is neutral.
If petitions are circulated, the registrar gains 1 and the union loses 1.

If compressed weeks are chosen and surveys are conducted, the result is even.
If protests occur, the registrar gains 3 and the union loses 3.
If forums are scheduled, the registrar loses 2 and the union gains 2.
If petitions are started, the registrar gains 2 and the union loses 2.

If rotating time blocks are met with surveys, the registrar gains 1 and the union loses 1.
If protests occur, the registrar loses 2 and the union gains 2.
If forums are used, the registrar gains 2 and the union loses 2.
If petitions are initiated, both sides receive 0.

If weekend intensives are paired with surveys, the registrar gains 1 and the union loses 1.
If protests are used, the registrar loses 3 and the union gains 3.
If forums are held, the response is neutral.
If petitions are circulated, the registrar gains 3 and the union loses 3.
