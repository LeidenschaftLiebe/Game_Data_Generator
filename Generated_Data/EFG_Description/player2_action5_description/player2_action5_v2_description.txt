  A5: tree canopy hideout.
Player2 counters with:
  B1: sound camouflage,
  B2: thermal net,
  B3: time-lapse rig,
  B4: weather adaptation,
  B5: nest tagging.
The outcome depends on how these choices intersect, adjusted by zero-sum rules.

Player1 selects from:
  A1: physics puzzle,
  A2: horror jump scares,
  A3: memory loop,
  A4: stealth levels,
  A5: time-bending plot.
Player2 counters with:
  B1: haptic suits,
  B2: eye-tracking,
  B3: social leaderboard,
  B4: AR merge,
  B5: streamer boost.
The outcome depends on how these choices intersect, adjusted by zero-sum rules.

Story 3: A Robotics Rescue Challenge
In this unique scenario, the conflict unfolds in the context of a robotics rescue challenge.
Player1 selects from:
  A1: fire extinguishing bot,
  A2: terrain climbing bot,
  A3: human detection,
  A4: relay drone,
  A5: modular AI.
Player2 counters with:
  B1: debris mapping,
  B2: emergency beacon,
  B3: obstacle surprise,
  B4: collapse simulation,
  B5: GPS blackout.
The outcome depends on how these choices intersect, adjusted by zero-sum rules.

Story 4: An Indie Game Speedrun Tournament
In this unique scenario, the conflict unfolds in the context of an indie game speedrun tournament.
Player1 selects from:
  A1: glitch skip,
  A2: reverse input,
  A3: perfect frame dash,
  A4: RNG manipulation,
  A5: stealth pacifist route.
Player2 counters with:
  B1: time penalty event,
  B2: random enemy AI,
  B3: stage remix,
  B4: fog overlay,
  B5: dev commentary mod.
The outcome depends on how these choices intersect, adjusted by zero-sum rules.

Base Payoff Definitions:
base_payoffs = {
    "Player1": [A1=10, A2=25, A3=50, A4=75, A5=100],
    "Player2": [B1=95, B2=35, B3=60, B4=20, B5=85]
}

Adjusted Payoff Calculation:
def adjusted_payoffs(i, j):
    raw = [base_payoffs['Player1'][i], base_payoffs['Player2'][j]]
    avg = sum(raw) / 2
    return [round(p - avg, 2) for p in raw]

Example:
If Player1 selects A2 (index 1) and Player2 selects B4 (index 3):
  Player1: 25, Player2: 20
  Average = (25 + 20) / 2 = 22.5
  Adjusted Payoffs = [Player1: 2.5, Player2: -2.5]
This ensures the total payoff remains zero-sum.
