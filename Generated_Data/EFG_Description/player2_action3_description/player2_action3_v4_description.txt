Base Payoff Definitions:
base_payoffs = {
    "Player1": [A1=3, A2=5, A3=2],
    "Player2": [B1=30, B2=40, B3=50]
}

Adjusted Payoff Calculation:
def adjusted_payoffs(i, j):
    raw = [base_payoffs['Player1'][i], base_payoffs['Player2'][j]]
    avg = sum(raw) / 2
    return [round(p - avg, 2) for p in raw]

Example:
If Player1 selects A1 (index 0) and Player2 selects B2 (index 1), we get:
  base_payoffs['Player1'][0] = 3
  base_payoffs['Player2'][1] = 40
  Average = (3 + 40) / 2 = 21.5
  Adjusted Payoffs = [Player1: -18.5, Player2: 18.5]
This ensures the total payoff always sums to zero.
