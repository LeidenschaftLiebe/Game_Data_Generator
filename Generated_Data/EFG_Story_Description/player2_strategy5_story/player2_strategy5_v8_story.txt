  A5: fake QR code.
Player2 counters with:
  B1: motion sensor,
  B2: curator reveal,
  B3: projection alarm,
  B4: press alert,
  B5: time lock.
The outcome depends on how these choices intersect, adjusted by zero-sum rules.

Player1 selects from:
  A1: encrypt archive,
  A2: deepfake trap,
  A3: public leak,
  A4: whistleblower redirect,
  A5: wipe trace.
Player2 counters with:
  B1: media leak,
  B2: hostage dump,
  B3: counter hack,
  B4: bot smear,
  B5: safe house trace.
The outcome depends on how these choices intersect, adjusted by zero-sum rules.

Story 3: A Virtual Fashion Catwalk
In this unique scenario, the conflict unfolds in the context of a virtual fashion catwalk.
Player1 selects from:
  A1: morphing dress,
  A2: neon coat,
  A3: body-reactive fabric,
  A4: 3D heels,
  A5: avatar mirror walk.
Player2 counters with:
  B1: catwalk glitch,
  B2: sparkle overload,
  B3: lag rewind,
  B4: vote surge,
  B5: social sim sabotage.
The outcome depends on how these choices intersect, adjusted by zero-sum rules.

Story 4: A Martian Science Fair
In this unique scenario, the conflict unfolds in the context of a Martian science fair.
Player1 selects from:
  A1: soil bacteria chip,
  A2: rover rebuild,
  A3: crop dome hack,
  A4: oxygen balloon,
  A5: Martian weather sim.
Player2 counters with:
  B1: judge probe,
  B2: radio jamming,
  B3: lab sabotage,
  B4: demo crash,
  B5: team betrayal.
The outcome depends on how these choices intersect, adjusted by zero-sum rules.

Base Payoff Definitions:
base_payoffs = {
    "Player1": [A1=15, A2=12, A3=9, A4=6, A5=3],
    "Player2": [B1=10, B2=8, B3=6, B4=4, B5=2]
}

Adjusted Payoff Calculation:
def adjusted_payoffs(i, j):
    raw = [base_payoffs['Player1'][i], base_payoffs['Player2'][j]]
    avg = sum(raw) / 2
    return [round(p - avg, 2) for p in raw]

Example:
If Player1 selects A2 (index 1) and Player2 selects B4 (index 3):
  Player1: 12, Player2: 4
  Average = (12 + 4) / 2 = 8.0
  Adjusted Payoffs = [Player1: 4.0, Player2: -4.0]
This ensures the total payoff remains zero-sum.
