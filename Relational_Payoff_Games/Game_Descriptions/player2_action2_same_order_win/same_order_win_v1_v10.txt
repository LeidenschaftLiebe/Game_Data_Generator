V1 - V10: 

1. Sailor vs. Storm

A sailor chooses a route, while the storm front determines the weather conditions.

The sailor can steer toward the open sea or the coastline.
The storm can bring calm winds or harsh winds.

If the sailor heads to the open sea, the storm always gives the sailor favorable conditions, no matter the winds.

If the sailor hugs the coastline, the storm always punishes the sailor. Calm winds reduce the damage, while harsh winds worsen it.






2. Farmer vs. Locust Swarm

A farmer plants crops, while locusts move across the fields.

The farmer can plant wheat or corn.
The locusts can swarm wheat fields or corn fields.

If wheat is planted, the locusts are always driven off, no matter which field they target.

If corn is planted, the locusts always cause harm. Swarming wheat fields is less damaging, while swarming corn fields devastates the harvest.






3. Pilot vs. Crosswind

A pilot selects an approach, while crosswinds shape the landing conditions.

The pilot can land on runway east or runway west.
The crosswind can blow from the east or from the west.

If the east runway is chosen, the pilot always lands safely, regardless of the wind direction.

If the west runway is chosen, the pilot always struggles. An east wind causes less trouble, while a west wind makes the landing far more dangerous.






4. Miner vs. Cave-in

A miner chooses where to dig, while cave-in risks remain hidden.

The miner can dig the north shaft or the south shaft.
The cave-in can occur in the north or the south.

If the north shaft is chosen, the miner always avoids disaster, whichever shaft collapses.

If the south shaft is chosen, the miner always suffers. A collapse in the north is less harmful, while a collapse in the south is much worse.






5. Explorer vs. Desert Heat

An explorer picks a route through the desert, while the sun scorches one side harder.

The explorer can travel along the dune ridge or the salt flats.
The heat can strike hardest at the ridge or at the flats.

If the ridge is chosen, the explorer always finds tolerable conditions, regardless of where the heat strikes.

If the flats are chosen, the explorer always suffers. Heat on the ridge makes it less severe, while heat on the flats makes it unbearable.






6. Fisher vs. Storm Current

A fisher sets out to sea, while unpredictable currents move through.

The fisher can cast nets in the shallow waters or the deep waters.
The current can shift toward the shallows or the deeps.

If shallow waters are chosen, the fisher always returns safely, no matter where the currents go.

If deep waters are chosen, the fisher always faces trouble. A current in the shallows eases the burden, while a current in the deeps makes it worse.






7. Runner vs. Weather

A marathon runner chooses a route, while the weather changes suddenly.

The runner can take the forest trail or the city streets.
The weather can turn rainy or sunny.

If the forest trail is taken, the runner always benefits, regardless of the weather.

If the city streets are taken, the runner always struggles. Rain is less of a problem, while bright sun causes a much harsher setback.






8. Diver vs. Tide

A diver decides where to descend, while the tide shifts.

The diver can dive near the coral reef or the open trench.
The tide can surge at the reef or the trench.

If the coral reef is chosen, the diver always enjoys calm conditions, whichever surge happens.

If the trench is chosen, the diver always risks trouble. A surge at the reef is less dangerous, while a surge at the trench is more threatening.






9. Shepherd vs. Wolves

A shepherd directs the flock, while wolves roam nearby.

The shepherd can lead sheep to the valley or the hillside.
The wolves can appear at the valley or the hillside.

If the valley is chosen, the shepherd always keeps the flock safe, no matter where wolves appear.

If the hillside is chosen, the shepherd always suffers losses. Wolves in the valley reduce the damage, while wolves in the hillside cause devastation.






10. Merchant vs. Market Prices

A merchant chooses what to sell, while the market shifts unpredictably.

The merchant can sell grain or wool.
The market can rise in grain prices or in wool prices.

If grain is sold, the merchant always profits, regardless of which price changes.

If wool is sold, the merchant always loses. A rise in grain prices softens the loss, while a rise in wool prices makes it much worse.
