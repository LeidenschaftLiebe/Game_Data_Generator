Description 1 Spy Scenario:

A spy chooses between two covert missions: infiltrating an enemy base or stealing intelligence files. 
A military commander then responds by either deploying troops to Sector Alpha or setting up a surveillance network. 
The commander does not know which mission was selected, since both response points fall within a single information set.

If the spy infiltrates and the commander deploys troops, the spy gains 2 and the commander loses 2. 
However, if surveillance is chosen instead, the spy loses 1 and the commander gains 1. 

If the spy steals files and troops are deployed, both receive 0. 
On the other hand, if surveillance is used instead, the spy gains 3 and the commander loses 3.

Description 2 Business Rivalry:

A startup CEO decides between two strategic moves: launching a new product or acquiring a competitor's patent. 
A rival firm’s executive must react by either investing heavily in marketing or shifting focus to legal defense. 
The rival executive cannot see which strategy the startup chose, making both decision points part of the same information set.

If the startup launches and the rival invests in marketing, the startup gains 2 and the rival loses 2. 
However, if the rival shifts to legal defense, the startup loses 1 and the rival gains 1. 

If the startup pursues the patent and the rival invests in marketing, the outcome is neutral. 
But if the rival uses legal defense, the startup gains 3 and the rival loses 3.

Description 3 Election Strategy:

A candidate selects one of two campaign strategies: focusing on rural outreach or urban digital media. 
The opponent’s campaign manager must respond by reallocating resources to traditional canvassing or data-driven analytics. 
The opponent does not know which strategy was chosen, as both reaction points are under one information set.

If the candidate focuses on rural areas and the opponent uses canvassing, the candidate gains 2 and the opponent loses 2. 
However, if analytics are used instead, the candidate loses 1 and the opponent gains 1. 

If the candidate chooses digital media and the opponent canvasses, both sides break even. 
On the other hand, if analytics are used instead, the candidate gains 3 and the opponent loses 3.

Description 4 Game Show Bluff:

A contestant secretly selects between opening Door A or Door B. 
The host must then decide to either add a cash bonus behind one door or introduce a penalty twist behind the other. 
The host does not know which door the contestant chose, and both host decision points belong to the same information set.

If the contestant picks Door A and the host adds a bonus, the contestant wins 2 and the host loses 2. 
While if the host introduces a twist, the contestant loses 1 and the host gains 1. 

If Door B is chosen and a bonus is added, the result is neutral. 
On the other hand, if a twist is added instead, the contestant gains 3 and the host loses 3.
