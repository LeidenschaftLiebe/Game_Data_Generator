V11 - V20: 

11. Hacker vs. System Admin

A hacker launches an intrusion, while the admin prepares defenses.

The hacker can strike with a zero-day exploit or a stolen password.
The admin can monitor live traffic or audit login patterns.

If the hacker uses the zero-day, the admin always fails, whichever defense is chosen.

If the hacker uses the stolen password, the admin always succeeds. Monitoring live traffic gives a stronger win, while auditing logins still works but with less impact.






12. Smuggler vs. Border Guard

A smuggler moves contraband toward a checkpoint, while the guard chooses how to intercept.

The smuggler can hide goods in the false floor of a truck or in a cargo container.
The guard can scan vehicles or check container manifests.

If the false floor is used, the guard always misses it, no matter the method.

If the cargo container is used, the guard always intercepts. Scanning vehicles delivers a bigger win, while checking manifests still catches the goods but less decisively.






13. Protester vs. Police

A protester plans to sneak banners into a rally, while police prepare crowd control.

The protester can conceal them in a backpack or in a rolled jacket.
The police can search bags at entry or patrol the seating area.

If the backpack is used, the police always fail to stop it, whichever action is taken.

If the rolled jacket is used, the police always succeed. Searching bags produces a stronger win, while patrolling seats still works but less effectively.






14. Thief vs. Watchman

A thief targets a mansion, while the night watchman sets his patrols.

The thief can sneak through the servant’s gate or the roof access.
The watchman can cover the gates or check the upper floors.

If the servant’s gate is chosen, the watchman always loses track, whichever patrol he makes.

If the roof access is chosen, the watchman always succeeds. Covering gates produces a bigger catch, while checking upper floors secures a smaller one.






15. Pirate vs. Convoy Escort

A pirate attacks shipping lanes, while the escort fleet chooses protection tactics.

The pirate can close in with small fast boats or a larger armed vessel.
The escort can launch fast interceptors or deploy heavier cannons.

If the armed vessel is used, the escort always wins. Launching fast interceptors secures a bigger win, while using cannons still succeeds but with less advantage.






16. Graffiti Artist vs. Transit Security

A graffiti artist sneaks into a train yard, while security prepares deterrents.

The artist can slip in with stealthy rollers or a loud spray compressor.
Security can trigger motion lights or send patrols through the yard.

If the compressor is used, security always succeeds. Motion lights provide a bigger win, while patrols still succeed with less impact.






17. Spy vs. Counterintelligence

A spy attempts to hand off secrets, while counterintelligence sets surveillance.

The spy can pass documents through a park drop or a café meeting.
Counterintelligence can watch public parks or monitor cafés.

If the park drop is used, counterintelligence always loses, whichever area is watched.

If the café meeting is used, counterintelligence always wins. Watching parks leads to a bigger success, while monitoring cafés delivers a smaller one.

The fraudster can attempt a shell company setup or a fake charity drive.
The investigator can analyze financial flows or review tax filings.

A racer plans a night run, while police try to intercept.

The racer can take the crowded downtown route or the empty bypass road.
