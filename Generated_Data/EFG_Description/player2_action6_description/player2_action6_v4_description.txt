Base Payoff Definitions:
base_payoffs = {
    "Player1": [A1=5, A2=10, A3=7, A4=3, A5=8, A6=12],
    "Player2": [B1=40, B2=50, B3=60, B4=70, B5=80, B6=90]
}

Adjusted Payoff Calculation:
def adjusted_payoffs(i, j):
    raw = [base_payoffs['Player1'][i], base_payoffs['Player2'][j]]
    avg = sum(raw) / 2
    return [round(p - avg, 2) for p in raw]

Example:
If Player1 selects A2 (index 1) and Player2 selects B5 (index 4):
  Player1: 10, Player2: 80
  Average = (10 + 80) / 2 = 45.0
  Adjusted Payoffs = [Player1: -35.0, Player2: 35.0]
This ensures the outcome remains zero-sum.
