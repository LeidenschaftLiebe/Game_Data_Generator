Version 1: "Market Micro-Moves" – A Digital Trading Competition
In a futuristic virtual stock exchange, three AI-powered trading bots compete daily for micro-gains in a tightly regulated environment.

Player1 represents a bot focusing on high-frequency trading:

A1 = Short-Term Arbitrage

A2 = Predictive Pricing Model

A3 = Dynamic Rebalancing

Player2 uses news sentiment analysis:

B1 = Breaking News Alert Mode

B2 = Political Volatility Filter

B3 = Quiet Market Mode

Player3 is a crypto-specialist:

C1 = Ethereum Derivatives

C2 = NFT Futures

C3 = Stablecoin Spread Optimization

Every combination of strategies leads to subtle decimal-scale profits or losses — measured in digital points — where one bot’s advantage means others earn less. For instance, if Player1 chooses A2 (1.75) and Player2 picks B3 (1.12), Player3 might counter with C2 (2.67), shifting the balance in their favor.





Version 2: "Space Race Diplomacy" – Martian Treaty Negotiations
Three planetary factions meet on Mars to negotiate resource-sharing from a newly discovered mineral zone.

Player1 (Earth Coalition):

A1 = Offer 20% cut

A2 = Share transport tech

A3 = Withhold mining secrets

Player2 (Lunar Trade Federation):

B1 = Trade helium-3

B2 = Propose time-limited access

B3 = Block treaty unless paid

Player3 (Asteroid Confederation):

C1 = Offer orbital maps

C2 = Threaten to build station

C3 = Neutral stance

Each move yields subtle influence scores — for example, Player2’s B1 (2.41) is aggressive and rewarding but vulnerable to C1 (1.04), a counter by Player3.

The payoffs represent political capital — whoever gains more sway causes the others to lose ground.





Version 3: "Indie Music Chart Battle"
Three underground artists release singles on the same weekend. They each choose their marketing strategy:

Player1:

A1 = Local Club Tour

A2 = TikTok Campaign

A3 = Radio Interviews

Player2:

B1 = YouTube MV Premiere

B2 = DJ Collaboration

B3 = Merch Drop

Player3:

C1 = Street Posters

C2 = Spotify Playlist Bribery

C3 = SoundCloud Livestream

The decimal payoffs represent fan engagement points. A combination like A2 + B3 + C2 leads to 1.75, 1.12, and 2.67 — the most viral moment for Player3, putting the others in the shadow. 





Version 4: "Academic Grant Draft"
Three research teams submit proposals for a prestigious innovation fund.

Player1: AI + Ethics

A1 = Focus on algorithm bias

A2 = LLM alignment techniques

A3 = Human-in-the-loop systems

Player2: Environmental Tech

B1 = Smart forest sensors

B2 = Carbon capture modeling

B3 = Agro-drone platforms

Player3: Health Biotech

C1 = CRISPR toolkit

C2 = Pandemic prediction

C3 = Nano drug delivery

Reviewers distribute decimal scores to reflect marginal gains in appeal or innovation. Small changes in proposal emphasis yield shifts like 1.48 vs. 2.41 vs. 1.89 — precision matters. 





Version 5: "Tabletop Strategy Duel: Guild Wars"
In a steampunk fantasy realm, three guilds strategize in a tabletop skirmish.

Player1 (Tinkerers’ Guild):

A1 = Deploy clockwork turrets

A2 = Hack enemy units

A3 = Smoke bomb retreat

Player2 (Alchemists’ Circle):

B1 = Fire flask volley

B2 = Regeneration elixir

B3 = Poison mist deployment

Player3 (Mystics’ Brotherhood):

C1 = Cast confusion

C2 = Summon shadow wraith

C3 = Mind reading

The decimal payoffs represent mana efficiency. When Player1 uses A3 (1.48) and Player2 drops B2 (1.96), a smart Player3 might use C3 (1.89) to balance the energy field and tilt the final result.
