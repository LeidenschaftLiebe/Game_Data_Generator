Game descriptions for mismatching actions (mismatch is a win for player 2 and match is a win for player 1). 

V21 - V30: 

21. Drone vs. Radar Operator

A drone (Player 1) flies over the Mountains or the Valley. A radar operator (Player 2) tunes sensors.

If the drone takes the Mountains, tuning to the Valley (win for Operator) picks up its return signal; tuning to the Mountains (loss for Operator) misses.

If the drone takes the Valley, tuning to the Mountains (win for Operator) catches it; tuning to the Valley (loss for Operator) fails.

This game is zero-sum: detection for the operator is a loss for the drone.






22. Explorer vs. Avalanche

An explorer (Player 1) climbs the Ice ridge or the Snow slope. An avalanche (Player 2) threatens.

If the explorer takes the Ice ridge, a slide on the Snow slope (win for Avalanche) cuts across and traps them; a slide on the Ice ridge (loss for Avalanche) misses.

If the explorer takes the Snow slope, a slide on the Ice ridge (win for Avalanche) sweeps them; a slide on the Snow slope (loss for Avalanche) fails.

This hazard is zero-sum: the avalanche’s strike is the explorer’s defeat.






23. Treasure Hunter vs. Trapmaster

A treasure hunter (Player 1) explores the Cavern or the Temple hall. A trapmaster (Player 2) sets snares.

If the hunter goes to the Cavern, setting traps in the Temple hall (win for Trapmaster) causes collapse at the exit; setting in the Cavern (loss for Trapmaster) misses.

If the hunter goes to the Temple hall, setting traps in the Cavern (win for Trapmaster) springs the choke; setting in the Temple hall (loss for Trapmaster) fails.

This contest is zero-sum: the trapmaster’s success is the hunter’s ruin.






24. Firefighter vs. Blaze

A fire (Player 1) spreads into the Library or the Gallery. The firefighter (Player 2) directs suppression.

If flames spread to the Library, spraying the Gallery (win for Firefighter) starves the fire’s path; spraying the Library (loss for Firefighter) wastes effort.

If flames spread to the Gallery, spraying the Library (win for Firefighter) cuts it off; spraying the Gallery (loss for Firefighter) fails.

This battle is zero-sum: suppression wins are fire’s losses.






25. Pilot vs. Storm

A pilot (Player 1) diverts through the North air lane or the South air lane. A storm front (Player 2) shifts.

If the pilot flies North, shifting storms to the South (win for Storm) traps the plane in turbulence; shifting North (loss for Storm) misses.

If the pilot flies South, shifting storms to the North (win for Storm) cuts across; shifting South (loss for Storm) fails.

This is zero-sum: the storm’s turbulence is the pilot’s setback.






26. Burglar vs. Alarm System

A burglar (Player 1) enters by the Front door or the Back door. The alarm system (Player 2) is calibrated.

If entry is through the Front, arming the Back sensor (win for Alarm) triggers the trap; arming the Front sensor (loss for Alarm) misses.

If entry is through the Back, arming the Front sensor (win for Alarm) works; arming the Back sensor (loss for Alarm) fails.

This is zero-sum: alarm success is burglar failure.






27. Scientist vs. Rival Lab

A scientist (Player 1) works on Project Alpha or Project Beta. A rival lab (Player 2) chooses which to publish against.

If the scientist pursues Alpha, publishing on Beta (win for Rival Lab) steals attention; publishing on Alpha (loss for Rival Lab) validates their work.

If the scientist pursues Beta, publishing on Alpha (win for Rival Lab) succeeds; publishing on Beta (loss for Rival Lab) fails.

This race is zero-sum: one lab’s recognition is the other’s loss.






28. Pirate vs. Navy

A pirate (Player 1) sails toward the Island route or the Open sea. The navy (Player 2) deploys ships.

If the pirate sails Island route, the navy at the Open sea (win for Navy) cuts them off; at the Island (loss for Navy) fails.

If the pirate sails Open sea, the navy at the Island (win for Navy) intercepts; at the Open sea (loss for Navy) fails.

This chase is zero-sum: capture for the navy is loss for the pirate.






29. Farmer vs. Weeds

A farmer (Player 1) sows in the East field or the West field. Weeds (Player 2) spread.

If sown in the East, weeds in the West (win for Weeds) creep into irrigation; weeds in the East (loss for Weeds) miss.

If sown in the West, weeds in the East (win for Weeds) infest; weeds in the West (loss for Weeds) fail.

This is zero-sum: weed growth cuts into farmer yield.






30. Actor vs. Critic

An actor (Player 1) performs Drama or Comedy. A critic (Player 2) writes reviews.

If the actor stages Drama, reviewing Comedy (win for Critic) shifts public taste; reviewing Drama (loss for Critic) reinforces success.

If the actor stages Comedy, reviewing Drama (win for Critic) undercuts them; reviewing Comedy (loss for Critic) fails.

This game is zero-sum: one’s acclaim is the other’s loss.
