Game descriptions for matching actions (match is a win for player 2 and mismatch is a win for player 1). 

V1 - V10: 

1. Spy vs. Agent

A spy (Player 1) must exfiltrate through either the North gate or the South gate. The agent (Player 2) decides where to intercept.

If the spy goes North, the agent intercepts by choosing North (win for Agent); choosing South (loss for Agent) lets the spy escape.

If the spy goes South, the agent intercepts by choosing South (win for Agent); choosing North (loss for Agent) fails.

This contest is zero-sum: whenever the agent wins, the spy loses by the same margin.






2. Fisherman vs. Shark

A fisherman (Player 1) rows to either the Lagoon or the Reef. A shark (Player 2) lurks nearby, deciding where to strike.

If the fisherman heads to the Lagoon, the shark succeeds by waiting at the Lagoon (win for Shark); if it goes to the Reef (loss for Shark), the fisherman is safe.

If the fisherman rows to the Reef, the shark succeeds by waiting at the Reef (win for Shark); choosing the Lagoon (loss for Shark) fails.

This encounter is zero-sum: the shark’s gain is the fisherman’s loss.






3. Smuggler vs. Customs Officer

A smuggler (Player 1) chooses to pass through the Checkpoint or take the Back road. The customs officer (Player 2) sets up inspection.

If the smuggler uses the Checkpoint, inspection at the Checkpoint (win for Officer) works; inspection at the Back road (loss for Officer) misses.

If the smuggler uses the Back road, inspection at the Back road (win for Officer) works; inspection at the Checkpoint (loss for Officer) misses.

This game is zero-sum: every seizure by the officer is an equal failure for the smuggler.






4. Miner vs. Claim Jumper

A miner (Player 1) digs at either the Gold seam or the Silver seam. A claim jumper (Player 2) decides where to stake a rival claim.

If the miner digs Gold, staking on Gold (win for Claim Jumper) blocks the miner; staking on Silver (loss for Claim Jumper) fails.

If the miner digs Silver, staking on Silver (win for Claim Jumper) blocks the miner; staking on Gold (loss for Claim Jumper) fails.

The setup is zero-sum: the claim jumper’s profit mirrors the miner’s loss.






5. Bird vs. Falcon

A bird (Player 1) seeks food either in the Meadow or the Forest. A falcon (Player 2) prepares to swoop.

If the bird goes to the Meadow, swooping into the Meadow (win for Falcon) catches it; swooping into the Forest (loss for Falcon) misses.

If the bird goes to the Forest, swooping into the Forest (win for Falcon) catches it; swooping into the Meadow (loss for Falcon) misses.

This chase is zero-sum: the falcon’s successful catch is exactly the bird’s failure.






6. Guard vs. Intruder

An intruder (Player 1) chooses between sneaking through the Left corridor or the Right corridor. The guard (Player 2) decides where to block.

If the intruder goes Left, blocking Left (win for Guard) succeeds; blocking Right (loss for Guard) fails.

If the intruder goes Right, blocking Right (win for Guard) succeeds; blocking Left (loss for Guard) fails.

This game is zero-sum: every success for the guard is an equal failure for the intruder.






7. Hacker vs. Security Analyst

A hacker (Player 1) launches an attack using either Exploit A or Exploit B. The security analyst (Player 2) applies a defense patch.

If the hacker uses Exploit A, applying Patch A (win for Analyst) blocks it; applying Patch B (loss for Analyst) fails.

If the hacker uses Exploit B, applying Patch B (win for Analyst) blocks it; applying Patch A (loss for Analyst) fails.

This contest is zero-sum: any protection by the analyst is matched by the hacker’s loss.






8. Predator vs. Prey

A rabbit (Player 1) chooses either the Burrow or the Field as an escape route. A fox (Player 2) chases.

If the rabbit goes to the Burrow, chasing into the Burrow (win for Fox) catches it; chasing into the Field (loss for Fox) fails.

If the rabbit goes to the Field, chasing into the Field (win for Fox) catches it; chasing into the Burrow (loss for Fox) fails.

This chase is zero-sum: the fox’s capture is the rabbit’s downfall.






9. Military Maneuver

A commander (Player 1) advances troops through the Valley or the Hill. The opposing general (Player 2) deploys forces.

If troops march through the Valley, deploying to the Valley (win for General) intercepts them; deploying to the Hill (loss for General) fails.

If troops march through the Hill, deploying to the Hill (win for General) intercepts them; deploying to the Valley (loss for General) fails.

This maneuver is zero-sum: one side’s gain is precisely the other’s loss.






10. Political Campaign

Candidate A (Player 1) focuses on either Urban voters or Rural voters. Candidate B (Player 2) decides where to counter-campaign.

If Candidate A campaigns in Urban areas, countering in Urban (win for Candidate B) succeeds; countering in Rural (loss for Candidate B) fails.

If Candidate A campaigns in Rural areas, countering in Rural (win for Candidate B) succeeds; countering in Urban (loss for Candidate B) fails.

This contest is zero-sum: Candidate B’s gains directly reduce Candidate A’s support.
