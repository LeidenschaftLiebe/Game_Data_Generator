Base Payoff Definitions:
base_payoffs = {
    "Player1": [A1=5, A2=6, A3=4, A4=5],
    "Player2": [B1=5, B2=4, B3=6, B4=5]
}

Adjusted Payoff Calculation:
def adjusted_payoffs(i, j):
    raw = [base_payoffs['Player1'][i], base_payoffs['Player2'][j]]
    avg = sum(raw) / 2
    return [round(p - avg, 2) for p in raw]

Example:
If Player1 selects A2 (index 1) and Player2 selects B3 (index 2):
  Player1: 6, Player2: 6
  Average = (6 + 6) / 2 = 6.0
  Adjusted Payoffs = [Player1: 0.0, Player2: 0.0]
