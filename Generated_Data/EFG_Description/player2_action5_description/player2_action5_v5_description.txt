Base Payoff Definitions:
base_payoffs = {
    "Player1": [A1=4, A2=-2, A3=3, A4=-1, A5=5],
    "Player2": [B1=-3, B2=6, B3=-4, B4=2, B5=-5]
}

Adjusted Payoff Calculation:
def adjusted_payoffs(i, j):
    raw = [base_payoffs['Player1'][i], base_payoffs['Player2'][j]]
    avg = sum(raw) / 2
    return [round(p - avg, 2) for p in raw]

Example:
If Player1 selects A2 (index 1) and Player2 selects B4 (index 3):
  Player1: -2, Player2: 2
  Average = (-2 + 2) / 2 = 0.0
  Adjusted Payoffs = [Player1: -2.0, Player2: 2.0]
This ensures the total payoff remains zero-sum.
