Base Payoff Definitions:
base_payoffs = {
    "Player1": [A1=-2, A2=-4, A3=-5, A4=-3],
    "Player2": [B1=-3, B2=-6, B3=-2, B4=-1]
}

Adjusted Payoff Calculation:
def adjusted_payoffs(i, j):
    raw = [base_payoffs['Player1'][i], base_payoffs['Player2'][j]]
    avg = sum(raw) / 2
    return [round(p - avg, 2) for p in raw]

Example:
If Player1 selects A2 (index 1) and Player2 selects B3 (index 2):
  Player1: -4, Player2: -2
  Average = (-4 + -2) / 2 = -3.0
  Adjusted Payoffs = [Player1: -1.0, Player2: 1.0]
