Base Payoff Definitions:
base_payoffs = {
    "Player1": [A1=-1, A2=-3, A3=-5, A4=-2, A5=-4],
    "Player2": [B1=-4, B2=-2, B3=-6, B4=-1, B5=-3]
}

Adjusted Payoff Calculation:
def adjusted_payoffs(i, j):
    raw = [base_payoffs['Player1'][i], base_payoffs['Player2'][j]]
    avg = sum(raw) / 2
    return [round(p - avg, 2) for p in raw]

Example:
If Player1 selects A2 (index 1) and Player2 selects B4 (index 3):
  Player1: -3, Player2: -1
  Average = (-3 + -1) / 2 = -2.0
  Adjusted Payoffs = [Player1: -1.0, Player2: 1.0]
This ensures the total payoff remains zero-sum.
