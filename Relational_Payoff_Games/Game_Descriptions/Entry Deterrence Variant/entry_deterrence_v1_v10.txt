1) Airline Routes (IncumbentAir vs SkyStart)

IncumbentAir first decides whether to commit to a full schedule or operate a limited schedule on a new regional route.

If IncumbentAir commits to a full schedule and SkyStart enters, the incumbent captures most passengers and does much better than the entrant.
If IncumbentAir opts for a limited schedule and SkyStart enters, both airlines compete on more even terms, each securing a fair share of travelers.
When SkyStart stays out, IncumbentAir enjoys complete dominance of the market, and a limited schedule reduces costs, allowing it to earn more.






2) Bottled Water (PureSpring vs FreshFlow)

PureSpring must decide whether to build high capacity or keep a smaller facility.
FreshFlow then decides whether to enter the bottled water market or stay out.

If PureSpring builds high capacity and FreshFlow enters, the incumbent floods the shelves and does far better than the new entrant.
If PureSpring stays small and FreshFlow enters, both sell competitively and share customers more evenly.
When FreshFlow stays out, PureSpring controls the entire market, with a smaller facility saving costs and improving its final position.






3) Electric Vehicles (Voltura vs EcoMotion)

Voltura decides whether to expand production or keep output steady for the next year.

If Voltura expands and EcoMotion enters, the established brand dominates sales and does much better than the entrant.
If Voltura keeps steady production and EcoMotion enters, both companies operate successfully, dividing the growing demand.
When EcoMotion stays out, Voltura remains the sole supplier, and producing efficiently with steady output leaves it better off.






4) Tech Gadgets (Nexon vs ByteRise)

Nexon must decide whether to introduce a low-priced model or maintain its premium pricing.
ByteRise observes the decision and then decides whether to enter the market or stay out.

If Nexon adopts low pricing and ByteRise enters, Nexon dominates sales and does significantly better than the entrant.
If Nexon maintains premium pricing and ByteRise enters, both share the midrange market on more balanced terms.
When ByteRise stays out, Nexon holds full control of the market, and premium pricing yields a higher margin.






5) Coffee Chains (BeanCraft vs UrbanRoast)

BeanCraft first decides whether to open stores widely or expand selectively across the city.
UrbanRoast then decides whether to enter or stay out.

If BeanCraft rolls out a wide network and UrbanRoast enters, the incumbent crowds the market and performs much better.
If BeanCraft keeps a limited expansion and UrbanRoast enters, both chains attract loyal customers and do reasonably well.
When UrbanRoast stays out, BeanCraft dominates all local demand, and a limited rollout keeps operations more efficient.






6) Online Retail (ShopVerse vs QuickCart)

QuickCart observes this and decides whether to enter the market or stay out.

If ShopVerse cuts prices and QuickCart enters, the incumbent keeps most buyers and does far better.
If ShopVerse keeps prices steady and QuickCart enters, both firms coexist with moderate success.
When QuickCart stays out, ShopVerse commands the market alone, and stable pricing improves profits.

RideMax sets its driver incentives before UrbanGo decides whether to enter the city market.

If RideMax offers high incentives and UrbanGo enters, RideMax attracts most drivers and riders, doing far better.

When UrbanGo stays out, RideMax keeps the entire customer base, and moderate incentives improve margins.






8) Energy Drinks (PowerBoost vs VitalRush)

VitalRush then decides whether to enter the market or stay out.

If PowerBoost produces at high levels and VitalRush enters, PowerBoost sells more and does far better than the new entrant.

When VitalRush stays out, PowerBoost enjoys full control, and keeping production moderate proves more efficient.






9) Cloud Storage (DataHarbor vs CloudGrid)

DataHarbor chooses whether to build large servers or keep limited capacity.
CloudGrid then decides whether to enter the cloud market or stay out.

If DataHarbor builds large capacity and CloudGrid enters, DataHarbor dominates corporate clients and performs much better.
