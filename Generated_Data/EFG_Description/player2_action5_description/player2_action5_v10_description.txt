  A4: old coin switch,
  A5: shadow man spot.
Player2 counters with:
  B1: loop acceleration,
  B2: suspect vanish,
  B3: memory block,
  B4: echo clue,
  B5: time limit push.
The outcome depends on how these choices intersect, adjusted by zero-sum rules.

Player1 selects from:
  A1: real-time pitch,
  A2: resume simulation,
  A3: VR team test,
  A4: sentiment analysis,
  A5: neural scan honesty.
Player2 counters with:
  B1: glitch test,
  B2: HR whisper,
  B3: panel bias,
  B4: past data leak,
  B5: public ranking drop.
The outcome depends on how these choices intersect, adjusted by zero-sum rules.

Story 3: A Climate Catastrophe Drill
In this unique scenario, the conflict unfolds in the context of a climate catastrophe drill.
Player1 selects from:
  A1: drone water drop,
  A2: heat bubble shield,
  A3: migration simulator,
  A4: forest firewall,
  A5: desal bot fleet.
Player2 counters with:
  B1: dust storm reroute,
  B2: signal jam,
  B3: riot override,
  B4: emergency ration,
  B5: satellite fog cover.
The outcome depends on how these choices intersect, adjusted by zero-sum rules.

Story 4: A Post-Capitalist Barter Economy
In this unique scenario, the conflict unfolds in the context of a post-capitalist barter economy.
Player1 selects from:
  A1: goat share,
  A2: solar hour loan,
  A3: bike co-op,
  A4: seed vault access,
  A5: knowledge pledge.
Player2 counters with:
  B1: offer revoke,
  B2: trust breakdown,
  B3: barter inflation,
  B4: crypto contest,
  B5: rainwater embargo.
The outcome depends on how these choices intersect, adjusted by zero-sum rules.

Base Payoff Definitions:
base_payoffs = {
    "Player1": [A1=1, A2=1, A3=1, A4=1, A5=25],
    "Player2": [B1=2, B2=2, B3=2, B4=2, B5=30]
}

Adjusted Payoff Calculation:
def adjusted_payoffs(i, j):
    raw = [base_payoffs['Player1'][i], base_payoffs['Player2'][j]]
    avg = sum(raw) / 2
    return [round(p - avg, 2) for p in raw]

Example:
If Player1 selects A2 (index 1) and Player2 selects B4 (index 3):
  Player1: 1, Player2: 2
  Average = (1 + 2) / 2 = 1.5
  Adjusted Payoffs = [Player1: -0.5, Player2: 0.5]
This ensures the total payoff remains zero-sum.
