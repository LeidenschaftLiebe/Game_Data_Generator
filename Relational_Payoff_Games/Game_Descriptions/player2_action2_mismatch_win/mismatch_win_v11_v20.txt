V11 - V20: 

11. Miner vs. Earthquake

A miner (Player 1) digs in the North shaft or the South shaft. An earthquake (Player 2) shakes the ground.

If the miner is in the North, shaking the South (win for Earthquake) collapses tunnels and traps them; shaking the North (loss for Earthquake) misses.

If the miner is in the South, shaking the North (win for Earthquake) collapses above them; shaking the South (loss for Earthquake) fails.

This contest is zero-sum: the quake’s strike is the miner’s loss.






12. Pilot vs. Missile System

A pilot (Player 1) flies over the East ridge or the West ridge. A missile system (Player 2) sets a lock.

If the pilot goes East, locking on the West (win for Missile) anticipates the maneuver; locking on the East (loss for Missile) fails.

If the pilot goes West, locking on the East (win for Missile) hits; locking on the West (loss for Missile) misses.

This duel is zero-sum: one’s gain is the other’s loss.






13. Smuggler vs. Inspector

A smuggler (Player 1) hides goods in the Crate or the Barrel. An inspector (Player 2) checks.

If the goods are in the Crate, checking the Barrel (win for Inspector) exposes the ploy; checking the Crate (loss for Inspector) fails.

If the goods are in the Barrel, checking the Crate (win for Inspector) reveals it; checking the Barrel (loss for Inspector) fails.

This inspection is zero-sum: smuggler’s concealment is inspector’s failure.

A shepherd (Player 1) leads sheep to the Pasture or the Barn. A wolf (Player 2) hunts.

If the sheep are in the Pasture, hunting the Barn (win for Wolf) cuts them off at the return path; hunting the Pasture (loss for Wolf) misses.

If the sheep are in the Barn, hunting the Pasture (win for Wolf) intercepts; hunting the Barn (loss for Wolf) fails.

This is zero-sum: wolf’s gain equals shepherd’s loss.






15. Scientist vs. Rival Publisher

A scientist (Player 1) submits findings to Journal A or Journal B. A rival (Player 2) plants counter-research.

If submitted to A, publishing in B (win for Rival) steals recognition; publishing in A (loss for Rival) backfires.

If submitted to B, publishing in A (win for Rival) succeeds; publishing in B (loss for Rival) fails.

This rivalry is zero-sum: one lab’s prestige is the other’s loss.

A knight (Player 1) charges along the Stone road or the Forest track. An archer (Player 2) lies in wait.

If the knight takes the Stone road, aiming at the Forest (win for Archer) shoots across at the exit; aiming at the Stone road (loss for Archer) misses.

If the knight takes the Forest track, aiming at the Stone road (win for Archer) intercepts; aiming at the Forest (loss for Archer) fails.

This clash is zero-sum: the archer’s strike is the knight’s defeat.






17. Diver vs. Current

A diver (Player 1) swims toward the Reef or the Trench. A current (Player 2) shifts.

If toward the Reef, pushing flow to the Trench (win for Current) sweeps the diver; pushing to the Reef (loss for Current) fails.

If toward the Trench, shifting to the Reef (win for Current) drags them; shifting to the Trench (loss for Current) misses.

This hazard is zero-sum: current’s pull is diver’s struggle.

If through the Harbor, patrolling the Gate (win for Enforcer) intercepts; patrolling the Harbor (loss for Enforcer) fails.

This encounter is zero-sum: enforcement gain equals merchant’s loss.

If on Healthcare, pushing Education (win for Opposition) changes debate; pushing Healthcare (loss for Opposition) fails.

This contest is zero-sum: one side’s support is the other’s loss.

If patching X, attacking Y (win for Hacker) succeeds; attacking X (loss for Hacker) fails.
