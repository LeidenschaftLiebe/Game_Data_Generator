11) Corporate Merger Negotiation

Two major companies are finalizing a $10 million merger benefit package.
The larger company begins by proposing either a 70/30 split or a 60/40 split, both in its favor.
If the smaller company accepts, the merger terms are settled immediately and profits are shared accordingly.
If the smaller company refuses, the lengthy review process causes a delay, shrinking the total available benefit to $8 million.
The smaller company then counters with a 45/55 offer favoring itself.
Finally, the larger company decides whether to accept this counterproposal or reject it.
If it rejects, both parties agree to a neutral fallback where they split the remaining $8 million evenly.






12) International Trade Agreement

Two governments are negotiating a $5 billion trade benefit distribution.
The exporting country starts by proposing either a 3.5/1.5 billion division or a 3.2/1.8 billion split favoring its exports.
If the importing country accepts, the agreement is signed immediately.
If it rejects, the delay reduces the total economic gain to $4 billion.
The importing country counters with a 1.8/2.2 billion allocation that favors its domestic industry.
The exporting country may then accept or reject.
Rejection leads to an equalized fallback, where each country earns $2 billion in trade benefits.






13) Renewable Energy Investment

A government agency and a private energy firm are negotiating a $4 million renewable energy subsidy.
The firm offers either a 2.6/1.4 million split or a 2.4/1.6 million split.
If the government rejects, red tape delays shrink the available fund to $3 million.
The government then counters with a 1.3/1.7 million allocation.
If the firm accepts, the contract proceeds; if it refuses, both settle for a $1.5 million each neutral funding share.






14) Sports Endorsement Contract

A sports brand and an athlete are negotiating a $2 million endorsement deal.
The brand begins by proposing 1.3M/0.7M or 1.2M/0.8M, both in its favor.
If the athlete declines, the brand risks media delays that reduce the total value to $1.5 million.
The athlete counters with 0.7M/0.8M, asking for a slightly larger share.
The brand can accept or reject; rejection leads to a fallback of 0.75M each.






15) Joint Film Distribution

A Hollywood studio and an international distributor split $6 million in global earnings.
The studio proposes 4.0M/2.0M or 3.6M/2.4M, favoring itself.
If the distributor declines, international clearance delays reduce the total to $4.8 million.
The distributor then offers 2.3M/2.5M.
If the studio refuses, both receive an even 2.4M each.






16) Inheritance Division Between Siblings

Two siblings are deciding how to divide a $1 million inheritance.
The older sibling proposes either a 600K/400K or 550K/450K split favoring themselves.
If the younger sibling refuses, legal consultations delay the settlement, reducing the available sum to $800K.
The younger sibling then counters with 380K/420K.
If the older sibling refuses, they each walk away with $400K.






17) Technology Partnership

A software firm and a hardware company split $3 million in profits.
The software firm first offers either 1.9M/1.1M or 1.8M/1.2M.

The hardware partner then counters with 1.1M/1.3M.
If the software firm declines, both settle for 1.2M each.






18) Nonprofit Partnership Funding

Two nonprofit organizations are dividing $1 million in joint grant funding.
The lead organization proposes 600K/400K or 550K/450K.
If the partner declines, administrative delays reduce the fund to $800K.
The partner counters with 370K/430K.
The lead can accept or reject, leading to a $400K each fallback.






19) Music Collaboration Profit Split

A music producer and a featured artist split $600K from streaming revenue.
The producer offers 400K/200K or 350K/250K.
If the artist refuses, release delays reduce the pool to $480K.
The artist counters with 220K/260K.
If the producer declines, both share $240K each.






20) Real Estate Agent Commission

Two real estate agents divide a $400K commission.
The senior agent first offers 250K/150K or 280K/120K, both self-favoring.
