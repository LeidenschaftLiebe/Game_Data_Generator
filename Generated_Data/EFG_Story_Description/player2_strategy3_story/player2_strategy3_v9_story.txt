Base Payoff Definitions:
base_payoffs = {
    "Player1": [A1=10, A2=-10, A3=10],
    "Player2": [B1=-10, B2=10, B3=-10]
}

Adjusted Payoff Calculation:
def adjusted_payoffs(i, j):
    raw = [base_payoffs['Player1'][i], base_payoffs['Player2'][j]]
    avg = sum(raw) / 2
    return [round(p - avg, 2) for p in raw]

Example:
If Player1 selects A1 (index 0) and Player2 selects B2 (index 1), we get:
  base_payoffs['Player1'][0] = 10
  base_payoffs['Player2'][1] = 10
  Average = (10 + 10) / 2 = 10.0
  Adjusted Payoffs = [Player1: 0.0, Player2: 0.0]
This ensures the total payoff always sums to zero.
