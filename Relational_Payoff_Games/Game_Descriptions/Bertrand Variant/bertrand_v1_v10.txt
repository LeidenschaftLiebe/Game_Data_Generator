1) Airline Tickets (Domestic Route)

Two airlines, AeroFly and SkyJet, sell identical economy tickets on the same route.

If both set Low fares, they split the market but earn only minimal profits.

Two stations, FuelMax and RoadOil, sell identical gasoline on the same highway stretch.
Each chooses whether to charge a High or Low price per liter.

If one cuts price while the other holds High, the cheaper one draws nearly all customers and earns more.
If both lower prices, profits become slim for both.






3) Mobile Data Plans

Two telecom firms, CellNet and ComWave, offer identical mobile data packages.
Each sets a High or Low price.
If both set High prices, they share subscribers evenly and earn good profits.

Two online retailers, TechZone and GigaStore, sell the same smartphone model.
Each can charge a High or Low price.
