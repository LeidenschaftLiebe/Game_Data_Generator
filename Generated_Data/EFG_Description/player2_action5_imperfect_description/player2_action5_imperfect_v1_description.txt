Description 1 Undercover Heist:

A thief selects one of five entry tactics: sewer infiltration, rooftop descent, hacking the vault system, posing as staff, or causing a diversion.
The museum’s chief of security must respond by assigning one of five countermeasures: motion sensors, extra guards, cyber forensics, internal screening, or lockdown protocols.
The chief cannot distinguish between sewer and rooftop approaches, responding to both as a shared threat.
Meanwhile, hacking, disguise, and diversion tactics are handled in a second information set.

If guards are deployed, the thief loses 1 and security gains 1.
If cyber forensics are used, both parties receive 0.
If internal screening is applied, the thief gains 1 and security loses 1.
If lockdown protocols are initiated, the thief gains 3 and security loses 3.

If rooftop descent meets motion sensors, the thief gains 1 and security loses 1.
If guards are deployed, the thief loses 2 and security gains 2.
If cyber forensics are used, the result is neutral.
If screening is done, the thief gains 2 and security loses 2.
If lockdown is triggered, the thief loses 3 and security gains 3.

If cyber forensics are used, the result is even.
If screening is done, the thief gains 1 and security loses 1.
If lockdown is triggered, the thief gains 2 and security loses 2.

If a diversion is created and met with sensors, the thief gains 3 and security loses 3.
If guards respond, the thief loses 1 and security gains 1.
If cyber forensics are used, the outcome is neutral.

Description 2 Diplomatic Summit Strategy:

An ambassador must choose among five diplomatic moves: bilateral talks, press briefing, economic proposal, intelligence leak, or public appeal.
The rival nation’s delegate must respond using one of five tactics: issuing a denial, hosting a counter-briefing, deploying sanctions, leaking misinformation, or initiating back-channel discussions.
The rival cannot distinguish between talks and press briefings, so they treat both as equivalent.
The remaining three actions—economic, leak, and appeal—form a second indistinguishable category.

If bilateral talks are followed by denial, the ambassador gains 2 and the rival loses 2.
If counter-briefing is held, the ambassador loses 1 and the rival gains 1.
If sanctions are issued, both break even.
If misinformation is leaked, the ambassador gains 1 and the rival loses 1.

If back-channels are triggered, the ambassador gains 2 and the rival loses 2.

If a public appeal is made and denial follows, the ambassador gains 3 and the rival loses 3.
If counter-briefing is conducted, the ambassador loses 1 and the rival gains 1.

Description 3 Space Mission Planning:

A space agency selects one of five mission plans: lunar rover, Mars orbiter, asteroid mining, Venus balloon, or deep space probe.
The international coalition responds with one of five resource decisions: approving fuel, granting data access, providing navigation updates, delaying funding, or sending scientific personnel.
The coalition cannot distinguish between lunar and Mars missions, treating both with a shared strategy.
The other three missions are treated as another group with common response options.

If the rover is supported with fuel, the agency gains 2 and the coalition loses 2.
If data access is granted, the agency loses 1 and the coalition gains 1.
If navigation is updated, the result is even.
If funding is delayed, the agency gains 1 and the coalition loses 1.
If personnel are sent, the agency gains 3 and the coalition loses 3.

If the Mars orbiter is met with fuel, the agency gains 1 and the coalition loses 1.
If data access follows, the agency loses 2 and the coalition gains 2.
