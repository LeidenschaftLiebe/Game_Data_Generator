V11 - V20: 

11. Archer vs. Wind

An archer prepares to shoot, while shifting winds determine the outcome.

The archer can aim at the target’s left side or the target’s right side.
The wind can blow from the left or from the right.

If the archer shoots at the left side, the wind always helps, no matter which way it blows.

If the archer shoots at the right side, the wind always harms. A leftward wind reduces the error, while a rightward wind makes the shot much worse.






12. Farmer vs. Drought

A farmer selects a crop, while the weather brings drought conditions.

The farmer can plant barley or rice.
The drought can strike lightly or severely.

If barley is planted, the farmer always succeeds, whether the drought is light or severe.

If rice is planted, the farmer always suffers. A light drought is less damaging, while a severe drought destroys the crop entirely.






13. Sailor vs. Reef

A sailor charts a course, while reefs lurk under the waves.

The sailor can sail by the channel or near the shoals.
The reef can be hidden in the channel or in the shoals.

If the channel is chosen, the sailor always passes safely, no matter where the reef lies.

If the shoals are chosen, the sailor always risks collision. A reef in the channel makes it less harmful, while a reef in the shoals makes it disastrous.






14. Soldier vs. Supply Shortage

A soldier must march with supplies, while scarcity sets in.

The soldier can march with rations or with ammunition.
The shortage can affect food or bullets.

If rations are carried, the soldier always stays prepared, regardless of which shortage strikes.

If ammunition is carried, the soldier always suffers. A shortage of food is less costly, while a shortage of bullets is far more costly.






15. Explorer vs. Jungle

An explorer pushes forward, while the jungle reveals its hazards.

The explorer can take the river path or the dense trail.
The jungle can bring snakes or leeches.

If the river path is taken, the explorer always gets through, no matter the hazard.

If the dense trail is taken, the explorer always suffers. Snakes are less harmful, while leeches are much worse.






16. Miner vs. Gas Leak

A miner digs into the earth, while hidden gases shift underground.

The miner can dig the upper shaft or the lower shaft.
The gas can leak into the upper shaft or the lower shaft.

If the upper shaft is chosen, the miner always works safely, no matter where the leak occurs.

If the lower shaft is chosen, the miner always faces danger. A leak in the upper shaft is less damaging, while a leak in the lower shaft is more deadly.






17. Hunter vs. Weather

A hunter sets out on the chase, while the weather turns.

The hunter can head into the meadows or the forest.
The weather can turn to fog or to storm.

If the meadows are chosen, the hunter always succeeds, no matter the weather.

If the forest is chosen, the hunter always struggles. Fog reduces visibility slightly, while storm conditions make the hunt impossible.






18. Fisher vs. Sharks

A fisher decides where to cast nets, while sharks roam the waters.

The fisher can cast in the lagoon or the deep waters.
The sharks can move into the lagoon or the deeps.

If the lagoon is chosen, the fisher always returns with a catch, regardless of where the sharks go.

If the deep waters are chosen, the fisher always faces danger. Sharks in the lagoon make it less risky, while sharks in the deeps make it far worse.






19. Rider vs. Avalanche

A rider crosses the mountains, while avalanches threaten.

The rider can take the ridge path or the valley road.
The avalanche can fall on the ridge or in the valley.

If the ridge path is taken, the rider always crosses safely, no matter where the avalanche falls.

If the valley road is taken, the rider always faces disaster. An avalanche on the ridge reduces the danger, while an avalanche in the valley makes it catastrophic.






20. Merchant vs. Bandits

A merchant travels with goods, while bandits wait along the roads.

The merchant can go by the king’s road or the forest track.
The bandits can set up on the king’s road or on the forest track.

If the king’s road is chosen, the merchant always avoids trouble, whichever road the bandits choose.

If the forest track is chosen, the merchant always suffers. Bandits on the king’s road make it a lighter loss, while bandits on the forest track make it a heavier one.
