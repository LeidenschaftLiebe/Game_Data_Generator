Game Description 1: Drone Combat Simulation

In the heart of drone combat simulation, critical choices carve the path to triumph.

**Player1** evaluates the following strategies:

  - And **Player2** counters with **flare deploy**, the resulting payoff is (11, -11).
  - And **Player2** counters with **swarm launch**, the resulting payoff is (-66, 66).
  - And **Player2** counters with **stealth shield**, the resulting payoff is (70, -70).
  - And **Player2** counters with **decoy clone**, the resulting payoff is (21, -21).

- If **Player1** selects **terrain nap**:
  - And **Player2** counters with **flare deploy**, the resulting payoff is (-96, 96).
  - And **Player2** counters with **swarm launch**, the resulting payoff is (-54, 54).
  - And **Player2** counters with **stealth shield**, the resulting payoff is (-23, 23).
  - And **Player2** counters with **decoy clone**, the resulting payoff is (-59, 59).

- If **Player1** selects **counter-jamming**:
  - And **Player2** counters with **flare deploy**, the resulting payoff is (-86, 86).
  - And **Player2** counters with **swarm launch**, the resulting payoff is (68, -68).
  - And **Player2** counters with **stealth shield**, the resulting payoff is (-11, 11).
  - And **Player2** counters with **decoy clone**, the resulting payoff is (15, -15).
