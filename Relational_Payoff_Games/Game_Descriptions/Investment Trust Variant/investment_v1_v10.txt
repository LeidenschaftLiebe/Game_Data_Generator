1) Community Seed Fund

A neighborhood organizer receives a small grant to support local projects.
They can either keep the funds for their own program or trust a neighborhood leader to manage it.

Afterward, the leader can choose to share a fair portion back with the organizer or keep the full benefit for themselves.





2) Gallery Patronage

An art patron considers whether to fund a small gallery.

The gallery can then choose to return a modest portion of the proceeds to the patron or keep all the gains.





3) Local Startup Booster

A seasoned entrepreneur mentors a young founder and must decide whether to invest some startup capital.

A boutique buyer can keep their funds or give them upfront to a rural craft cooperative to start production.

7) Athlete Sponsorship

A sponsor considers whether to fund a young athlete’s training season.

8) City Pilot Program

A city office must decide whether to keep its pilot funds or transfer them to a neighborhood organization.

9) Producer Prepayment

A film studio can keep its funds or prepay an independent producer for a new series.

10) Green Infrastructure Trust

A renewable energy funder can retain their investment capital or entrust it to a local developer for an infrastructure project.
If they keep their money, it remains safe but unused.
