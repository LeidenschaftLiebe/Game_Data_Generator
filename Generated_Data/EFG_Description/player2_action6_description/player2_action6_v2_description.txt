Base Payoff Definitions:
base_payoffs = {
    "Player1": [A1=10, A2=25, A3=50, A4=75, A5=90, A6=100],
    "Player2": [B1=95, B2=35, B3=60, B4=20, B5=85, B6=15]
}

Adjusted Payoff Calculation:
def adjusted_payoffs(i, j):
    raw = [base_payoffs['Player1'][i], base_payoffs['Player2'][j]]
    avg = sum(raw) / 2
    return [round(p - avg, 2) for p in raw]

Example:
If Player1 selects A2 (index 1) and Player2 selects B5 (index 4):
  Player1: 25, Player2: 85
  Average = (25 + 85) / 2 = 55.0
  Adjusted Payoffs = [Player1: -30.0, Player2: 30.0]
This ensures the outcome remains zero-sum.
