Game descriptions for when player 1 = action 1, then player 2 wins with either action; 
when player 1 chooses action 2, player 2 loses either way, but action 1 results in a smaller loss.
V21 - V30: 

21. Boxer vs. Crowd

A boxer (Player 1) uses a Standard combo or an Unusual move. The crowd (Player 2) reacts with Cheers or Boos.

If using the Standard combo, Cheers (win for Crowd) or Boos (win for Crowd) both reward the crowd’s power.

If using the Unusual move, the crowd always loses, though Cheers (smaller loss for Crowd) hurt less than Boos (bigger loss for Crowd).

Zero-sum: crowd satisfaction mirrors boxer’s struggle.






22. Engineer vs. System

An engineer (Player 1) powers up Circuit A or Circuit B. The system (Player 2) responds with Overload or Short circuit.

If Circuit A is powered, Overload (win for System) or Short circuit (win for System) always cripple it.

If Circuit B is powered, the system always fails, though Overload (smaller loss for System) is less severe than Short circuit (bigger loss for System).

Zero-sum: system’s resistance equals engineer’s setback.






23. Farmer vs. Flood

A farmer (Player 1) irrigates the Upper field or the Lower field. The flood (Player 2) spreads through Overflow or Backflow.

If in the Upper field, Overflow (win for Flood) or Backflow (win for Flood) always ruin crops.

If in the Lower field, the flood always fails, though Overflow (smaller loss for Flood) is less than Backflow (bigger loss for Flood).

Zero-sum: flood’s rise is farmer’s loss.






24. Runner vs. Heat

A runner (Player 1) trains in the Morning or the Afternoon. The heat (Player 2) strikes with Humidity or Scorching sun.

If in the Morning, Humidity (win for Heat) or Scorching sun (win for Heat) always hinder.

If in the Afternoon, the heat always fails, though Humidity (smaller loss for Heat) is less harsh than Scorching sun (bigger loss for Heat).

Zero-sum: weather gains equal runner’s setbacks.






25. Captain vs. Fog

A captain (Player 1) sails via the Shore route or the Deep route. Fog (Player 2) rolls in as Thick mist or Low clouds.

If the Shore route is chosen, Thick mist (win for Fog) or Low clouds (win for Fog) always obscure navigation.

If the Deep route is chosen, fog always fails, though Low clouds (smaller loss for Fog) are less costly than Thick mist (bigger loss for Fog).

Zero-sum: fog’s concealment equals captain’s difficulty.






26. Athlete vs. Injury

An athlete (Player 1) trains Technique or Strength. Injury (Player 2) strikes through Sprain or Fatigue.

If focusing on Technique, Sprain (win for Injury) or Fatigue (win for Injury) always set them back.

If focusing on Strength, injury always fails, though Sprain (smaller loss for Injury) is less harmful than Fatigue (bigger loss for Injury).

Zero-sum: injury’s gain is athlete’s loss.






27. Pilot vs. Crosswinds

A pilot (Player 1) lands on Runway East or Runway West. Crosswinds (Player 2) shift Toward the nose or Toward the tail.

If using Runway East, either shift Toward the nose (win for Crosswinds) or Toward the tail (win for Crosswinds) always destabilizes.

If using Runway West, crosswinds always fail, though Toward the nose (smaller loss for Crosswinds) is less damaging than Toward the tail (bigger loss for Crosswinds).

Zero-sum: crosswind strength equals pilot’s struggle.






28. Performer vs. Stage Light

A performer (Player 1) acts under the Main spotlight or the Side light. The lights (Player 2) flicker with Dimness or Color shifts.

If under the Main spotlight, Dimness (win for Lights) or Color shifts (win for Lights) always spoil the scene.

If under the Side light, the lights always fail, though Dimness (smaller loss for Lights) is milder than Color shifts (bigger loss for Lights).

Zero-sum: lights’ disruption equals performer’s loss.






29. Builder vs. Earthquake

A builder (Player 1) constructs on the Plateau or the Valley. The quake (Player 2) shakes with Tremors or Aftershocks.

If on the Plateau, Tremors (win for Quake) or Aftershocks (win for Quake) always damage.

If on the Valley, the quake always fails, though Tremors (smaller loss for Quake) hurt less than Aftershocks (bigger loss for Quake).

Zero-sum: quake’s strike equals builder’s failure.






30. Fisher vs. Current

A fisher (Player 1) casts in the Bay or the Harbor. The current (Player 2) moves with Tide rise or Undertow.

If in the Bay, Tide rise (win for Current) or Undertow (win for Current) always spoil the catch.

If in the Harbor, the current always fails, though Tide rise (smaller loss for Current) is less harmful than Undertow (bigger loss for Current).

Zero-sum: current’s gain equals fisher’s loss.
