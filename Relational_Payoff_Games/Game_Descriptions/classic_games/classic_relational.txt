1. Prisoner’s Dilemma

Two suspects are held in separate cells, unable to communicate. Each must decide whether to stay silent or betray the other.

If both stay silent, they each get a light sentence.

If one betrays while the other stays silent, the betrayer goes free while the other receives a heavy sentence.

If both betray, they both receive medium sentences.

Each gain for one comes at the expense of the other.






2. Stag Hunt

Two hunters head into the forest. They can either cooperate to hunt a stag or go alone after a hare.

If both hunt stag, they succeed together and share a large reward.

If one hunts stag while the other goes for hare, the hare hunter earns a small catch while the stag hunter goes home empty-handed.

If both hunt hare, each receives a modest but safe reward.

The more reward one gains, the more the other is forced to give up. 






3. Chicken (Hawk–Dove)

Two drivers race toward each other on a collision course. Each must decide whether to swerve or stay straight.

If one swerves and the other stays straight, the one who stays straight “wins,” while the one who swerves “loses.”

If both swerve, neither looks tough, but both avoid disaster.

If both stay straight, they crash and both suffer greatly.

The outcome is a trade-off—whatever one secures, the other pays for.






4. Battle of the Sexes

A couple wants to spend the evening together, but they disagree on what to do: one prefers the opera, the other the football game.

If both attend the opera, they enjoy the evening together, though the opera lover is happier.

If both attend the football game, they again enjoy it together, though the football fan is happier.

If they split between events, neither is satisfied.

The more one advances, the more the rival is pushed back.






5. Matching Pennies

Two players each secretly choose heads or tails and reveal simultaneously.

If both choose the same side, the first player wins.

If they choose differently, the second player wins.

Every advantage for one becomes a disadvantage for the other. 






6. Rock–Paper–Scissors

Two players simultaneously choose between rock, paper, and scissors.

Rock beats scissors, but loses to paper.

Scissors beat paper, but lose to rock.

Paper beats rock, but loses to scissors.

If both choose the same, it ends in a draw.

The winner's reward is matched exactly by the loser’s loss.
