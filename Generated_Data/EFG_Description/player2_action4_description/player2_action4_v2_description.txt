Base Payoff Definitions:
base_payoffs = {
    "Player1": [A1=10, A2=30, A3=70, A4=90],
    "Player2": [B1=40, B2=20, B3=60, B4=100]
}

Adjusted Payoff Calculation:
def adjusted_payoffs(i, j):
    raw = [base_payoffs['Player1'][i], base_payoffs['Player2'][j]]
    avg = sum(raw) / 2
    return [round(p - avg, 2) for p in raw]

Example:
If Player1 selects A2 (index 1) and Player2 selects B3 (index 2):
  Player1: 30, Player2: 60
  Average = (30 + 60) / 2 = 45.0
  Adjusted Payoffs = [Player1: -15.0, Player2: 15.0]
