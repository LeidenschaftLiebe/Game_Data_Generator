Base Payoff Definitions:
base_payoffs = {
    "Player1": [A1=5, A2=6, A3=7, A4=6, A5=5, A6=4],
    "Player2": [B1=5, B2=4, B3=3, B4=4, B5=5, B6=6]
}

Adjusted Payoff Calculation:
def adjusted_payoffs(i, j):
    raw = [base_payoffs['Player1'][i], base_payoffs['Player2'][j]]
    avg = sum(raw) / 2
    return [round(p - avg, 2) for p in raw]

Example:
If Player1 selects A2 (index 1) and Player2 selects B5 (index 4):
  Player1: 6, Player2: 5
  Average = (6 + 5) / 2 = 5.5
  Adjusted Payoffs = [Player1: 0.5, Player2: -0.5]
This ensures the outcome remains zero-sum.
