Base Payoff Definitions:
base_payoffs = {
    "Player1": [A1=0, A2=1, A3=2, A4=3, A5=4, A6=5],
    "Player2": [B1=5, B2=4, B3=3, B4=2, B5=1, B6=0]
}

Adjusted Payoff Calculation:
def adjusted_payoffs(i, j):
    raw = [base_payoffs['Player1'][i], base_payoffs['Player2'][j]]
    avg = sum(raw) / 2
    return [round(p - avg, 2) for p in raw]

Example:
If Player1 selects A2 (index 1) and Player2 selects B5 (index 4):
  Player1: 1, Player2: 1
  Average = (1 + 1) / 2 = 1.0
  Adjusted Payoffs = [Player1: 0.0, Player2: 0.0]
This ensures the outcome remains zero-sum.
