Base Payoff Definitions:
base_payoffs = {
    "Player1": [A1=1, A2=1, A3=1, A4=1, A5=1, A6=25],
    "Player2": [B1=2, B2=2, B3=2, B4=2, B5=2, B6=30]
}

Adjusted Payoff Calculation:
def adjusted_payoffs(i, j):
    raw = [base_payoffs['Player1'][i], base_payoffs['Player2'][j]]
    avg = sum(raw) / 2
    return [round(p - avg, 2) for p in raw]

Example:
If Player1 selects A2 (index 1) and Player2 selects B5 (index 4):
  Player1: 1, Player2: 2
  Average = (1 + 2) / 2 = 1.5
  Adjusted Payoffs = [Player1: -0.5, Player2: 0.5]
This ensures the outcome remains zero-sum.
