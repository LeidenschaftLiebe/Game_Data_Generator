1. Ultimatum Game – “The Found Treasure”

Two treasure hunters discover a chest of gold coins. 
One of them takes the lead and decides how to split the coins between them. 
The other hunter can either accept the deal or refuse it. 
If the deal is refused, neither of them keeps any coins.






2. Dictator Game – “The Bakery Owner”

A baker closes shop with a basket of leftover bread. 
A hungry traveler asks for some. 
The baker alone decides how many loaves to share and how many to keep. 
The traveler has no say — they must take whatever is given.






3. Trust (Investment) Game – “The Seed Exchange”

A farmer receives a handful of seeds and may choose to give some to a neighbor for planting. 
Whatever is given multiplies in the neighbor’s fields, yielding far more crops. 
The neighbor then decides how many of the harvested crops to share back with the farmer, keeping the rest for themselves.






4. Centipede Game – “The Growing Pot”

Two gamblers sit at a table with a small pile of coins. 
On each turn, the player can either grab the pile immediately or push it forward, letting it grow as more coins are added. 
The longer they pass it back and forth, the larger the pot becomes — but at any moment, 
one can seize it, leaving the other with less.






5. Rubinstein Alternating-Offers – “The Orchard Bargain”

Two villagers inherit an orchard full of ripe fruit. 
They must agree on how to divide the harvest. 
One makes an offer, and the other may accept or counter with their own split. 
With each day they delay, fruit spoils, and the total harvest shrinks. 
The longer they bargain, the less there is to divide.
