Description 1 Heist Setup:

A crew leader selects one of three approaches to enter a secure facility: scaling the rooftop, sneaking through the basement, or using a forged ID at the front entrance.
The head of security must respond by choosing one of three countermeasures: deploying guards, activating surveillance, or initiating a lockdown.
Security cannot distinguish between the rooftop and basement entries, meaning both are handled through a single information set.
The front entrance, however, is evaluated separately.

If the rooftop is chosen and guards are deployed, the crew gains 2 and security loses 2.
However, if surveillance is activated instead, the crew loses 1 and security gains 1.
If a lockdown is initiated, both sides break even.

If the basement is chosen and guards are deployed, both parties receive 0.
On the other hand, if surveillance is used, the crew gains 3 and security loses 3.
If a lockdown is triggered, the crew loses 2 and security gains 2.

If the front entrance is attempted and guards are deployed, the crew gains 1 and security loses 1.
However, if surveillance is chosen, the crew suffers a loss of 2 and security gains 2.
If a lockdown is initiated instead, the crew gains 2 and security loses 2.

Description 2 Space Frontier Tactics:

A space commander selects one of three tactical maneuvers: orbiting behind a moon, executing a stealth approach, or broadcasting false coordinates.
The alien defense system must react by choosing among launching attack drones, activating sensor arrays, or raising planetary shields.
The defense system cannot detect whether the ship is hiding or approaching stealthily, and thus must respond to both maneuvers from a shared information set.
The false broadcast, however, prompts a separate reaction.

If the ship hides behind the moon and drones are launched, the commander gains 2 and the aliens lose 2.
However, if sensors are activated instead, the commander loses 1 and the aliens gain 1.
If shields are raised, both sides remain unaffected.

If the stealth approach is chosen and drones are launched, the result is neutral.
On the other hand, if sensors are used, the commander gains 3 and the aliens lose 3.
If shields are raised instead, the commander loses 2 and the aliens gain 2.

If false coordinates are broadcast and drones are launched, the commander gains 1 and the aliens lose 1.
However, if sensors are activated, the commander loses 2 and the aliens gain 2.
If shields are raised instead, the commander gains 2 and the aliens lose 2.

Description 3 Corporate Espionage:

An undercover agent chooses between accessing internal servers, bribing a low-level employee, or impersonating an executive.
Corporate security must respond with one of three defensive actions: initiating a sweep, increasing surveillance, or launching legal proceedings.
Security cannot tell whether the agent is targeting internal systems or personnel and must respond to both cases uniformly, while impersonation triggers a distinct response.

If the agent accesses servers and a sweep is initiated, the agent gains 2 and the firm loses 2.
However, if surveillance is intensified instead, the agent loses 1 and the firm gains 1.
If legal action is triggered, the outcome is neutral.

If bribery is used and a sweep is initiated, both sides break even.
On the other hand, if surveillance is increased, the agent gains 3 and the firm loses 3.
If legal action is pursued instead, the agent loses 2 and the firm gains 2.

If impersonation is attempted and the firm launches a sweep, the agent gains 1 and the firm loses 1.
However, if surveillance is used, the agent loses 2 and the firm gains 2.
If legal action is triggered instead, the agent gains 2 and the firm loses 2.

Description 4 Treasure Hunt Game Show:

A contestant secretly selects one of three treasure boxes: Box A, Box B, or Box C.
The game host then decides on one of three twists: hiding a jackpot, placing a decoy, or leaving the box empty.
The host cannot determine whether the contestant picked Box A or B and must assign the same twist to both.
Box C, however, is revealed through a separate information set.

If Box A is selected and a jackpot is hidden, the contestant wins 2 and the show loses 2.
However, if a decoy is placed instead, the contestant loses 1 and the show gains 1.
If the box is left empty, both sides break even.

If Box B is selected and a jackpot is added, the result is neutral.
On the other hand, if a decoy is placed, the contestant gains 3 and the show loses 3.
If the box is left empty instead, the contestant loses 2 and the show gains 2.

If Box C is selected and receives the jackpot, the contestant gains 1 and the show loses 1.
However, if it holds a decoy, the contestant loses 2 and the show gains 2.
If the box is left empty instead, the contestant gains 2 and the show loses 2.
