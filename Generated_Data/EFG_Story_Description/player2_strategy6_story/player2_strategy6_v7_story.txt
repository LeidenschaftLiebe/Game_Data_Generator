Base Payoff Definitions:
base_payoffs = {
    "Player1": [A1=25, A2=30, A3=35, A4=40, A5=45, A6=50],
    "Player2": [B1=2, B2=3, B3=4, B4=5, B5=6, B6=7]
}

Adjusted Payoff Calculation:
def adjusted_payoffs(i, j):
    raw = [base_payoffs['Player1'][i], base_payoffs['Player2'][j]]
    avg = sum(raw) / 2
    return [round(p - avg, 2) for p in raw]

Example:
If Player1 selects A2 (index 1) and Player2 selects B5 (index 4):
  Player1: 30, Player2: 6
  Average = (30 + 6) / 2 = 18.0
  Adjusted Payoffs = [Player1: 12.0, Player2: -12.0]
This ensures the outcome remains zero-sum.
