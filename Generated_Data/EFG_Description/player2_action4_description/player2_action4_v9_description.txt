Game Description 1: Robotics Soccer Match

In the heart of robotics soccer match, critical choices carve the path to triumph.

**Player1** evaluates the following strategies:

  - And **Player2** counters with **double bot**, the resulting payoff is (-4, 4).
  - And **Player2** counters with **override AI**, the resulting payoff is (69, -69).

- If **Player1** selects **mid-air block**:
  - And **Player2** counters with **goalie upgrade**, the resulting payoff is (59, -59).
  - And **Player2** counters with **obstacle ram**, the resulting payoff is (72, -72).
  - And **Player2** counters with **double bot**, the resulting payoff is (4, -4).
  - And **Player2** counters with **override AI**, the resulting payoff is (31, -31).
