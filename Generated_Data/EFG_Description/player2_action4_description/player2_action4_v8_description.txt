Base Payoff Definitions:
base_payoffs = {
    "Player1": [A1=12, A2=9, A3=6, A4=3],
    "Player2": [B1=8, B2=5, B3=2, B4=0]
}

Adjusted Payoff Calculation:
def adjusted_payoffs(i, j):
    raw = [base_payoffs['Player1'][i], base_payoffs['Player2'][j]]
    avg = sum(raw) / 2
    return [round(p - avg, 2) for p in raw]

Example:
If Player1 selects A2 (index 1) and Player2 selects B3 (index 2):
  Player1: 9, Player2: 2
  Average = (9 + 2) / 2 = 5.5
  Adjusted Payoffs = [Player1: 3.5, Player2: -3.5]
