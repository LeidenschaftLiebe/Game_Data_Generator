Story 1: A Science Fair Faceoff
During this dramatic face-off, Player1 must decide between A1: robotic arm demo and A2: AI-powered game, each reflecting a different tactical approach.
On the other side, Player2 prepares to react with either B1: interactive board or B2: graphical simulation, knowing that their choice will intersect with Player1’s to determine the outcome.
The tension in a science fair faceoff mirrors the uncertainty of game theory itself—each participant hoping to outguess the other.

Story 2: A Street Racing Final
In the heat of the game, Player1 must decide between A1: tight cornering and A2: nitro boost, each reflecting a different tactical approach.
On the other side, Player2 prepares to react with either B1: drifting technique or B2: early acceleration, knowing that their choice will intersect with Player1’s to determine the outcome.

Payoff Matrix (Base values shown as Player1, Player2):
        B1      B2
A1  (-1, -2)
A2  (-5, -3)

Payoff Adjustment Rule:
The outcomes are shaped by a base payoff matrix, with adjustments made by subtracting the average of both players' base scores from each individual score. This ensures the result remains zero-sum, making each decision a strategic gamble.
