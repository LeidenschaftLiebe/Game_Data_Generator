1. Cournot Duopoly

Two firms simultaneously choose how many units to produce of a homogeneous product. The market price falls when total supply is high.

Suppose each firm must choose between producing low (q = 10) or high (q = 20) units. The market price is determined so that:

If both produce low, each firm’s profit is $60.

If one produces high and the other low, the high producer’s profit is $80 while the low producer’s is $40.

If both produce high, price drops and each firm’s profit is $50.






2. Bertrand (Homogeneous Goods)

Two firms simultaneously set the price of an identical good. Consumers buy from the cheaper firm; if prices tie, they split the market.

Imagine marginal cost is $10 for both. They can set price $15 or $12. The demand size such that:

If both charge $15, they split demand and each earns $50.

If one charges $12 while the other charges $15, the $12 firm captures the entire market and earns $90; the $15 firm sells nothing and earns $0.

If both charge $12, they again split the market and each earns $45.






3. Stackelberg Duopoly

One firm (the leader) commits to a quantity first, then the follower chooses.

Suppose the leader chooses between low (10 units) or high (20 units). 
Then the follower, knowing the leader’s choice, picks low or high. Using the same demand and cost structure as above:

If the leader picks low and follower picks low, leader gets $60, follower $60.

If leader picks low and follower picks high, follower gets $80, leader gets $40.

If leader picks high and follower picks low, leader gets $80, follower gets $40.

If both pick high, they each get $50.






4. Entry Deterrence (Capacity / Limit Pricing)

An incumbent firm must decide whether to adopt an aggressive (low) price or a modest (high) price. 

Then a potential entrant decides whether to enter.

If the incumbent sets a high price and the entrant stays out, the incumbent earns $100 and the entrant gets $0.

If incumbent sets high but entrant still enters, they compete and each ends up with $40.

If incumbent sets a low price and the entrant stays out, the incumbent earns $70.

If incumbent sets low and entrant enters, intense competition leads to incumbent earning $30, entrant earning $10.






5. War of Attrition / All-Pay

Two players are fighting over a single prize worth $50. 

Each must secretly decide whether to put in a small effort of $10 or a large effort of $20. 

Everyone pays their effort cost no matter what, and only one player walks away with the prize.

If both put in small effort, they each spend $10. One of them is chosen to receive the prize. 

The winner’s net is $40 (the $50 prize minus the $10 cost), and the loser is left at –$10.

If one puts in small effort while the other puts in large effort, the larger effort guarantees the prize. 

The winner spends $20 but gains the $50 prize, finishing with $30. The smaller effort loses, leaving that player at –$10.

If both put in large effort, they each spend $20. One of them still wins the $50 prize, finishing with $30. 

The loser, having spent $20 without reward, ends at –$20.
