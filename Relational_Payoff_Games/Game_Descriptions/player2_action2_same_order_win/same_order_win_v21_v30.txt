V21 - V30: 

21. Firefighter vs. Blaze

A firefighter decides where to deploy hoses, while the blaze spreads unpredictably.

The firefighter can focus on the warehouse or the office block.
The blaze can surge in the warehouse or the offices.

If the warehouse is chosen, the firefighter always contains the fire, no matter where it spreads.

If the office block is chosen, the firefighter always loses ground. A surge in the warehouse makes the loss smaller, while a surge in the offices makes it far worse.






22. Diver vs. Current

A diver descends into the ocean, while currents shift below.

The diver can dive near the reef or into the trench.
The current can sweep the reef or the trench.

If the reef is chosen, the diver always has safe conditions, whichever way the current flows.

If the trench is chosen, the diver always struggles. A current at the reef makes it less severe, while a current in the trench makes it much more dangerous.






23. Soldier vs. Trap

A soldier advances into enemy territory, while traps are hidden in the terrain.

The soldier can take the main road or the side path.
The traps can be placed on the main road or the side path.

If the main road is taken, the soldier always avoids the traps, no matter where they are.

If the side path is taken, the soldier always triggers danger. Traps on the main road lessen the damage, while traps on the side path make it deadly.






24. Pilot vs. Flak

A pilot chooses a flight path, while anti-aircraft fire is set up.

The pilot can fly over the river valley or the mountain ridge.
The flak can target the valley or the ridge.

If the river valley is chosen, the pilot always gets through safely, regardless of where the flak fires.

If the mountain ridge is chosen, the pilot always takes damage. Fire aimed at the valley is less harmful, while fire aimed at the ridge is devastating.






25. Athlete vs. Injury

An athlete picks a training method, while injuries lurk unseen.

The athlete can train with endurance runs or with weightlifting.
The injury can appear as muscle strain or joint pain.

If endurance runs are chosen, the athlete always stays healthy, whichever injury risk is present.

If weightlifting is chosen, the athlete always gets hurt. Muscle strain makes it lighter, while joint pain makes it worse.






26. Commander vs. Weather

A commander plans troop movement, while storms threaten.

The commander can march across the plain or through the forest.
The storm can break over the plain or the forest.

If the plain is chosen, the commander always succeeds, no matter where the storm strikes.

If the forest is chosen, the commander always falters. A storm on the plain is less costly, while a storm in the forest is disastrous.






27. Logger vs. Forest Hazard

A logger chooses where to cut, while hidden hazards arise.

The logger can cut the north grove or the south grove.
The hazard can strike in the north or in the south.

If the north grove is chosen, the logger always works safely, no matter the hazard.

If the south grove is chosen, the logger always suffers. A hazard in the north is less harmful, while a hazard in the south is much worse.






28. Rider vs. Sandstorm

A rider crosses the desert, while a sandstorm brews.

The rider can ride along the ridge path or the dune flats.
The sandstorm can sweep the ridge or the flats.

If the ridge path is chosen, the rider always gets through safely, whichever area is hit.

If the dune flats are chosen, the rider always suffers. A storm at the ridge is less damaging, while a storm at the flats is crushing.






29. Farmer vs. Pest Infestation

A farmer prepares fields, while pests spread across the crops.

The farmer can plant in the north field or the south field.
The pests can swarm the north or the south.

If the north field is planted, the farmer always succeeds, no matter where pests attack.

If the south field is planted, the farmer always fails. Pests in the north reduce the loss, while pests in the south destroy everything.






30. Explorer vs. Avalanche

An explorer climbs in the mountains, while avalanches threaten.

The explorer can climb the ice slope or the snow pass.
The avalanche can fall on the slope or the pass.

If the ice slope is climbed, the explorer always avoids danger, regardless of where the avalanche falls.

If the snow pass is climbed, the explorer always faces danger. An avalanche on the slope makes it lighter, while an avalanche on the pass makes it deadly.
