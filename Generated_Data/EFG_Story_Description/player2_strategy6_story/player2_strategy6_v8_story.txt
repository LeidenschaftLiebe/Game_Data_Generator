Base Payoff Definitions:
base_payoffs = {
    "Player1": [A1=18, A2=15, A3=12, A4=9, A5=6, A6=3],
    "Player2": [B1=10, B2=8, B3=6, B4=4, B5=2, B6=0]
}

Adjusted Payoff Calculation:
def adjusted_payoffs(i, j):
    raw = [base_payoffs['Player1'][i], base_payoffs['Player2'][j]]
    avg = sum(raw) / 2
    return [round(p - avg, 2) for p in raw]

Example:
If Player1 selects A2 (index 1) and Player2 selects B5 (index 4):
  Player1: 15, Player2: 2
  Average = (15 + 2) / 2 = 8.5
  Adjusted Payoffs = [Player1: 6.5, Player2: -6.5]
This ensures the outcome remains zero-sum.
