  A1: bio-sensor patch,
  A2: protein folding fix,
  A3: in-vitro meat,
  A4: lung regenerator,
  A5: smart microbes.
Player2 counters with:
  B1: ethical audit,
  B2: cost attack,
  B3: patient feedback,
  B4: data breach,
  B5: rival patent drop.
The outcome depends on how these choices intersect, adjusted by zero-sum rules.

Base Payoff Definitions:
base_payoffs = {
    "Player1": [A1=5, A2=10, A3=7, A4=3, A5=8],
    "Player2": [B1=40, B2=50, B3=60, B4=70, B5=80]
}

Adjusted Payoff Calculation:
def adjusted_payoffs(i, j):
    raw = [base_payoffs['Player1'][i], base_payoffs['Player2'][j]]
    avg = sum(raw) / 2
    return [round(p - avg, 2) for p in raw]

Example:
If Player1 selects A2 (index 1) and Player2 selects B4 (index 3):
  Player1: 10, Player2: 70
  Average = (10 + 70) / 2 = 40.0
  Adjusted Payoffs = [Player1: -30.0, Player2: 30.0]
This ensures the total payoff remains zero-sum.
