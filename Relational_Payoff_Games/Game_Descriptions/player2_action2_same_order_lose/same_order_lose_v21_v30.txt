21. Archaeologist vs. Temple Traps

Deep in a buried complex, an archaeologist weighs two ways in, while ancient defenses still lurk.

The archaeologist can enter via the collapsed stairway or the sealed door.
The traps can trigger falling stones or poison darts.

If the archaeologist chooses the collapsed stairway, the traps fail either way; whether stones or darts are primed, the traps lose all the same.

If the archaeologist chooses the sealed door, the traps succeed whichever is set, and falling stones produce a bigger win for the traps than poison darts.






22. Journalist vs. Censorship Board

A reporter prepares a story while the board decides how to react.

The journalist can submit a controversial exposé or a mild feature.
The board can block publication or delay review.

If the journalist submits the exposé, the board’s efforts fail either way; blocking or delaying both end in the same loss for the board.

If the journalist submits the mild feature, the board succeeds regardless, and blocking yields a bigger win for the board than delaying.






23. Explorer vs. Jungle Hazard

An explorer plans the next leg; the jungle “chooses” which danger shows up.

The explorer can take the swamp trail or the rocky slope.
The hazard can be snakes or falling rocks.

If the explorer takes the swamp trail, the hazards come to nothing; snakes or rocks, the jungle loses in the same way.

If the explorer takes the rocky slope, the hazards prevail either way, and snakes give the jungle a bigger win than falling rocks.






24. Diver vs. Shipwreck Currents

A diver approaches a wreck while currents swirl unpredictably.

The diver can descend along the collapsed mast or the cargo hatch.
The currents can surge near the mast or the hatch.

If the diver chooses the collapsed mast, the currents are beaten either way; surging at mast or hatch, the currents lose just the same.

If the diver chooses the cargo hatch, the currents dominate regardless, and a surge at the mast gives the currents a bigger win than a surge at the hatch.






25. Detective vs. Criminal Mastermind

A detective tracks a mastermind who plants misdirections.

The detective can pursue a dockside trail or a market trail.
The mastermind can seed dockside false leads or market decoys.

If the detective follows the dockside trail, the mastermind’s ploys fail either way; dockside or market tricks both amount to the same loss for the mastermind.

If the detective follows the market trail, the mastermind’s misdirections succeed regardless, and dockside false leads hand the mastermind a bigger win than market decoys.






26. Farmer vs. Storm

A farmer picks where to work as a storm system builds.

The farmer can tend the lowland field or the hillside field.
The storm can bring hail or flooding rain.

If the farmer chooses the lowland field, the weather loses either way; hail or flood, the storm’s effect is the same loss for the storm.

If the farmer chooses the hillside field, the weather wins regardless, and hail yields a bigger win for the storm than flooding rain.






27. Student vs. Teacher

An oral exam begins; the teacher must decide which angle to press.

The student can focus on ancient history or modern politics.
The teacher can ask about dates and events or causes and debates.

If the student chooses ancient history, the teacher’s questioning falls flat either way; dates or causes, it’s the same loss for the teacher.

If the student chooses modern politics, the teacher’s approach works regardless, and dates and events deliver a bigger win for the teacher than causes and debates.






28. Rebel vs. Governor’s Guard

A rebel eyes two targets, while the guard allocates defenses.

The rebel can strike the palace gate or the supply depot.
The guard can fortify the gate or guard the depot.

If the rebel strikes the palace gate, the guard fails either way; fortifying or guarding, it’s the same loss for the guard.

If the rebel strikes the supply depot, the guard succeeds regardless, and fortifying the gate produces a bigger win for the guard than guarding the depot.






29. Rider vs. Desert Winds

A long crossing lies ahead; the winds will decide where to bite.

The rider can choose the dune ridge or the sand basin.
The winds can whip up sandstorms or crosswinds.

If the rider takes the dune ridge, the winds are beaten either way; sandstorms or crosswinds both mean the same loss for the winds.

If the rider takes the sand basin, the winds prevail regardless, and sandstorms give the winds a bigger win than crosswinds.






30. Captain vs. Naval Blockade

A captain seeks a breakthrough while the blockade lines reshuffle.

The captain can steer through the strait or the open waters.
The blockade can deploy torpedo boats or minefields.

If the captain chooses the strait, the blockade’s posture fails either way; boats or mines, it’s the same loss for the blockade.

If the captain chooses the open waters, the blockade succeeds regardless, and torpedo boats secure a bigger win for the blockade than minefields.
