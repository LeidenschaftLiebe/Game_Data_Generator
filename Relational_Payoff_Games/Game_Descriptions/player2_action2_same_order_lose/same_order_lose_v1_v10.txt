Game descriptions for when player 1 = action 1, then player 2 loses with either action; 
when player 1 chooses action 2, player 2 wins either way, but action 1 results in a bigger win.
V1 - V10: 

1. Poacher vs. Park Ranger

Night falls over a protected reserve. A poacher prepares a hunt while a ranger decides how to respond.

The poacher can operate with a silenced bow or a noisy truck spotlight.
The ranger can launch a drone sweep or patrol on foot.

If the poacher uses the silenced bow, the ranger fails no matter what—both the drone sweep and the foot patrol come up empty.

If the poacher uses the truck spotlight, the ranger succeeds either way; the drone sweep rolls up a larger success, while the foot patrol still succeeds but with fewer confiscations.






2. Counterfeiter vs. Bank Teller

A counterfeiter tests a branch’s procedures; the head teller sets the screening approach.

The counterfeiter can pass notes via a distraction handoff or a front-counter deposit.
The teller can run UV/pen checks on the spot or route bills to back-office verification.

If the distraction handoff is used, the teller misses it regardless—both on-the-spot checks and back-office verification let it slip.

If the front-counter deposit is used, the teller catches it either way; on-the-spot checks make a bigger catch, while back-office verification still catches it but with less impact.






3. Ticket Scalper vs. Event Security

Outside a sold-out arena, a scalper works the crowd while security chooses a tactic.

The scalper can move with roving whispers or set up a fixed corner post.
Security can run targeted stings or do wide visible sweeps.

If the scalper roves with whispers, security comes up short either way—both stings and visible sweeps fail to land arrests.

If the scalper sets a fixed post, security succeeds either way; targeted stings yield a bigger haul, while visible sweeps still work but net fewer.






4. Data Leaker vs. Compliance Officer

A staffer plans to exfiltrate files; compliance chooses how to monitor.

The leaker can use a zero-day exfil tool or a personal email forward.
Compliance can enable deep packet inspection or audit email rules and headers.

If the zero-day tool is used, compliance misses it regardless—both DPI and email audits fail to surface it.

If personal email is used, compliance stops it either way; DPI produces a stronger stop with richer forensics, while email audits still block it but with a thinner trail.






5. Graffiti Crew vs. Transit Inspector

A graffiti crew targets a rail yard at night; the inspector picks a deterrent.

The crew can strike with silent rollers or with a compressor sprayer.
The inspector can deploy motion-sensor lights or increase guard walk-throughs.

If silent rollers are used, the inspector’s efforts fail either way—lights and walk-throughs both miss the taggers.

If the compressor sprayer is used, the inspector succeeds either way; motion-sensor lights produce a bigger deterrent, 
while extra walk-throughs still disperse the crew but less decisively.






6. Pirate Vendor vs. Market Marshal

A street seller moves bootleg goods; the marshal sets enforcement.

The vendor can sell via coded handoffs or a front-table display.
The marshal can run plainclothes buys or stage uniformed checkpoints.

If coded handoffs are used, enforcement fails regardless—both plainclothes buys and checkpoints come up empty.

If a front-table display is used, enforcement succeeds either way; plainclothes buys deliver a larger bust, while checkpoints still work but with a smaller haul.






7. Insider Tipster vs. Exchange Surveillance

A tipster plans trades; the exchange chooses a surveillance focus.

The tipster can act through a mule account network or a single retail account.
Surveillance can tighten cross-account pattern detection or watch single-account anomalies.

If the mule network is used, surveillance misses it either way—both cross-account and single-account watches fail this time.

If the single account is used, surveillance flags it either way; cross-account detection generates a stronger case, 
while single-account monitoring still catches it but with a slimmer pattern.






8. Blackmailer vs. Cybercrime Detective

A blackmailer readies a drop; the detective chooses how to intercept.

The blackmailer can demand payment via a privacy coin mixer or a mainstream wallet.
The detective can trace mixers with chain analytics or monitor exchange KYC alerts.

If the mixer route is used, the detective loses track either way—both analytics and KYC alerts fail to pin it down.

If the mainstream wallet is used, the detective succeeds either way; chain analytics build a stronger case, while KYC alerts still secure a positive ID but with less detail.






9. Drone Trespasser vs. Stadium Security

A drone operator seeks a stadium flyover; security picks a response.

The operator can fly a low-signature microdrone or a standard quadcopter.
Security can deploy RF takeover or dispatch a net-gun team.

If the microdrone is used, security fails regardless—both RF takeover and net-gun response come up short.

If the quadcopter is used, security succeeds either way; RF takeover produces a cleaner capture, while the net-gun team still brings it down but with more fuss.






10. Art Thief vs. Museum Chief of Security

A thief plans a lift from a gallery; the chief sets the counter.

The thief can exploit a vent crawl or a crowd-blend exit.
Security can pivot cameras to choke points or flood floors with guards.

If the vent crawl is used, security loses either way—camera pivots and extra guards both fail to intercept.

If the crowd-blend exit is used, security succeeds either way; camera pivots secure a clearer stop, while added guards still catch the thief but with less precision.
