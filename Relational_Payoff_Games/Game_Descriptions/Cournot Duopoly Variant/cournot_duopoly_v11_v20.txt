Two manufacturers, GreenSpire and EcoWind, supply turbines to energy firms.

20) Semiconductor Foundries

Two semiconductor foundries, ChipCore and NanoEdge, produce the same type of wafer.
Each chooses whether to run a High or Low production cycle.
When both operate at High capacity, chip prices fall and profits are modest but equal.
When one runs High and the other Low, the price balances at a medium level, favoring the larger producer.
