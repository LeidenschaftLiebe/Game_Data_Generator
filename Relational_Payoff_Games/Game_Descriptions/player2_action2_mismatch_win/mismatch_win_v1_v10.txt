Game descriptions for mismatching actions (mismatch is a win for player 2 and match is a win for player 1). 

V1 - V10: 

1. Guard vs. Intruder (interception at a reconverging junction)

An intruder (Player 1) sprints into the Left corridor or the Right corridor of a building where both corridors rejoin at a choke point. The guard (Player 2) can position at either corridor’s far exit.

If the intruder takes Left, posting at Right (win for Guard) cuts them off at the rejoin; posting at Left (loss for Guard) trails behind and misses.

If the intruder takes Right, posting at Left (win for Guard) intercepts at the choke; posting at Right (loss for Guard) arrives late.

This game is zero-sum: the guard’s interception is the intruder’s failure.






2. Hacker vs. Security Analyst (honeypot strategy)

A hacker (Player 1) targets Service A or Service B. The analyst (Player 2) can harden one and arm a honeypot on the other.

If the hacker hits Service A, priming the honeypot on B (win for Analyst) lures the pivot and captures credentials; hardening A (loss for Analyst) only scares off the probe and yields little intel.

If the hacker hits Service B, priming the honeypot on A (win for Analyst) traps the pivot; hardening B (loss for Analyst) just blocks without attribution.

This contest is zero-sum: analyst gains (attribution/capture) are the hacker’s losses.






3. Predator vs. Prey (cut-off at a fork that reconverges)

A hare (Player 1) chooses the Ridge path or the Stream path; both meet at a narrow gap downstream. A fox (Player 2) chooses which exit to guard.

If the hare takes the Ridge, the fox waiting at the Stream exit (win for Fox) reaches the gap first and cuts off; waiting at the Ridge exit (loss for Fox) ends up behind.

If the hare takes the Stream, guarding the Ridge exit (win for Fox) cuts off; guarding the Stream exit (loss for Fox) trails.

This chase is zero-sum: a successful cut-off is the hare’s loss.






4. Military Maneuver (flanking into the opposite pass)

A column (Player 1) advances via the North pass or the South pass, which both open onto the same valley floor. The opposing general (Player 2) chooses which pass to block with a flanking force.

If the column takes the North pass, blocking the South pass (win for General) forces the enemy into the open where artillery already sights the gap; blocking North (loss for General) meets a head-on grind the column can slip past.

If the column takes the South pass, blocking the North pass (win for General) enables a cross-fire trap; blocking South (loss for General) engages on unfavorable ground.

This maneuver is zero-sum: one side’s tactical success is the other’s loss.






5. Political Campaign (contrast strategy)

Candidate A (Player 1) chooses to headline Economy or Security. Candidate B (Player 2) picks which issue to spotlight in contrast, aiming to redefine the news cycle.

If A leads with Economy, B gains more by pushing Security (win for Candidate B) to reframe priorities; pushing Economy (loss for Candidate B) only repeats A’s frame.

If A leads with Security, B gains more by pushing Economy (win for Candidate B); pushing Security (loss for Candidate B) reinforces A.

This contest is zero-sum: B’s narrative gains erode A’s.






6. Smuggler vs. Patrol (diversion at the other route)

A smuggler (Player 1) chooses the Coastal road or the Inland road to a harbor where both roads merge. The patrol (Player 2) can stage a diversion checkpoint to push traffic into a planned stop.

If the smuggler uses the Coastal road, setting the diversion on the Inland road (win for Patrol) reroutes flows into the main trap; setting it on Coastal (loss for Patrol) leaves the merge open.

If the smuggler uses the Inland road, diverting the Coastal road (win for Patrol) channels them into the stop; diverting Inland (loss for Patrol) backfires.

This is zero-sum: an interception for patrol is failure for the smuggler.






7. Student vs. Examiner (counter-topic)

A student (Player 1) prepares Topic A or Topic B. The examiner (Player 2) chooses which topic to emphasize.

If the student studies A, emphasizing B (win for Examiner) exposes the gap; emphasizing A (loss for Examiner) rewards preparation.

If the student studies B, emphasizing A (win for Examiner) exposes the gap; emphasizing B (loss for Examiner) rewards preparation.

This exam setup is zero-sum: examiner difficulty equals student difficulty.






8. Market Rivalry (counter-programming)

Brand A (Player 1) launches a campaign around Feature X or Feature Y. Rival B (Player 2) decides what to advertise.

If A spotlights Feature X, B wins more by advertising Feature Y (win for Rival B) to capture dissatisfied shoppers; advertising X (loss for Rival B) just validates A.

If A spotlights Feature Y, B gains by advertising Feature X (win for Rival B); advertising Y (loss for Rival B) cedes the frame.

This market fight is zero-sum: one brand’s lift is the other’s drop.






9. Network Defender (isolation vs. pivot)

An attacker (Player 1) breaches via Endpoint A or Endpoint B. The defender (Player 2) must choose which other segment to isolate to trap a likely pivot.

If the breach is on A, isolating B (win for Defender) strands the attacker’s escape path; isolating A (loss for Defender) tips them off and they exfiltrate.

If the breach is on B, isolating A (win for Defender) traps the pivot; isolating B (loss for Defender) warns them.

This defense is zero-sum: containment for the defender is failure for the attacker.






10. Logistics Race (cutting the alternate lane)

A competitor (Player 1) moves cargo via Rail or Highway to a hub where both streams consolidate. The dispatcher (Player 2) can throttle the opposite lane to force a bottleneck at the merge they control.

If cargo comes by Rail, throttling the Highway (win for Dispatcher) forces a predictable merge window; throttling Rail (loss for Dispatcher) creates chaos they cannot exploit.

If cargo comes by Highway, throttling the Rail (win for Dispatcher) sets up the trap; throttling Highway (loss for Dispatcher) misses the chance.

This race is zero-sum: the dispatcher’s advantage is the competitor’s delay.
