Base Payoff Definitions:
base_payoffs = {
    "Player1": [A1=4, A2=-3, A3=5, A4=-1],
    "Player2": [B1=-2, B2=6, B3=-4, B4=3]
}

Adjusted Payoff Calculation:
def adjusted_payoffs(i, j):
    raw = [base_payoffs['Player1'][i], base_payoffs['Player2'][j]]
    avg = sum(raw) / 2
    return [round(p - avg, 2) for p in raw]

Example:
If Player1 selects A2 (index 1) and Player2 selects B3 (index 2):
  Player1: -3, Player2: -4
  Average = (-3 + -4) / 2 = -3.5
  Adjusted Payoffs = [Player1: 0.5, Player2: -0.5]
