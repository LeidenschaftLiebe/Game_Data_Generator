V11 - V20: 

11. Librarian vs. Bookworm

A bookworm (Player 1) sneaks into the Reading room or the Storage vault. The librarian (Player 2) patrols the Entrance or the Shelves.

If the bookworm enters the Reading room, patrolling the Entrance (win for Librarian) or the Shelves (win for Librarian) always stops them.

If the bookworm enters the Storage vault, the librarian always fails, though patrolling the Entrance (smaller loss for Librarian) slows them more than patrolling the Shelves (bigger loss for Librarian).

This game is zero-sum: one’s access is the other’s loss.






12. Farmer vs. Drought

A farmer (Player 1) plants in the Low field or the High field. The drought (Player 2) dries the Irrigation canals or the Wells.

If crops are in the Low field, drying the Canals (win for Drought) or the Wells (win for Drought) always destroys the harvest.

If crops are in the High field, the drought always fails, though drying the Wells (smaller loss for Drought) is less costly than drying the Canals (bigger loss for Drought).

This contest is zero-sum: water scarcity is the farmer’s misfortune.






13. Sailor vs. Storm

A sailor (Player 1) sails the Northern waters or the Southern waters. The storm (Player 2) brings High winds or Heavy rain.

If sailing north, High winds (win for Storm) or Heavy rain (win for Storm) always disrupt the voyage.

If sailing south, the storm always fails, though Heavy rain (smaller loss for Storm) does more harm than High winds (bigger loss for Storm).

This struggle is zero-sum: the storm’s disruption equals the sailor’s peril.






14. Actor vs. Audience

An actor (Player 1) performs a Classic play or an Experimental script. The audience (Player 2) responds with Applause or Criticism.

If the Classic play is staged, Applause (win for Audience) or Criticism (win for Audience) both validate the crowd’s power.

If the Experimental script is staged, the audience always loses, though Applause (smaller loss for Audience) is less damaging than Criticism (bigger loss for Audience).

This contest is zero-sum: audience sentiment shapes the actor’s fortunes.






15. Soldier vs. Desert

A soldier (Player 1) marches via the Main road or the Hidden path. The desert (Player 2) unleashes Sandstorms or Heat waves.

If the Main road is chosen, Sandstorms (win for Desert) or Heat waves (win for Desert) always drain supplies.

If the Hidden path is chosen, the desert always fails, though Sandstorms (smaller loss for Desert) do less harm than Heat waves (bigger loss for Desert).

This game is zero-sum: desert’s grip is soldier’s hardship.






16. Diver vs. Jellyfish

A diver (Player 1) swims at the Surface or the Deep zone. Jellyfish (Player 2) gather in Shallow water or Near the reef.

If at the Surface, Shallow swarms (win for Jellyfish) or Reef swarms (win for Jellyfish) always sting.

If in the Deep zone, jellyfish always fail, though Reef swarms (smaller loss for Jellyfish) are less costly than Shallow swarms (bigger loss for Jellyfish).

This encounter is zero-sum: jellyfish stings are diver’s losses.






17. Politician vs. Press

A politician (Player 1) speaks on the Budget or on Defense. The press (Player 2) headlines Scandals or Policy critiques.

If the speech is on the Budget, Scandals (win for Press) or Policy critiques (win for Press) dominate the cycle.

If the speech is on Defense, the press always loses, though Scandals (smaller loss for Press) do less harm than Policy critiques (bigger loss for Press).

This contest is zero-sum: media framing erodes political gain.






18. Trader vs. Market

A trader (Player 1) sells Gold or Silver. The market (Player 2) shifts through Price drops or Shortages.

If selling Gold, Price drops (win for Market) or Shortages (win for Market) always hurt the trader.

If selling Silver, the market always fails, though Price drops (smaller loss for Market) sting less than Shortages (bigger loss for Market).

This trade is zero-sum: market’s swings mirror trader’s loss.






19. Teacher vs. Pupils

A teacher (Player 1) assigns Homework or a Group project. Pupils (Player 2) react with Compliance or Resistance.

If Homework is given, Compliance (win for Pupils) or Resistance (win for Pupils) both leave them in control.

If a Group project is given, pupils always fail, though Compliance (smaller loss for Pupils) is less harmful than Resistance (bigger loss for Pupils).

This is zero-sum: pupils’ success mirrors teacher’s setback.






20. Detective vs. Mystery

A detective (Player 1) follows the Main lead or the Cold trail. The mystery (Player 2) hides False clues or Witness silence.

If on the Main lead, False clues (win for Mystery) or Witness silence (win for Mystery) always block the case.

If on the Cold trail, the mystery always fails, though False clues (smaller loss for Mystery) do less harm than Witness silence (bigger loss for Mystery).

This puzzle is zero-sum: concealment equals detective’s struggle.
